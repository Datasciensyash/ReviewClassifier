1,"Movie is so boring and very unrealistic, people only gives good reviews because they think it's insulting or disrespectful to Paul Walker which it isn't. Movie is so unrealistic and boring, actors are so boring throughout the series and people think they are good actors only because of their looks. Like really? Driving one building to another? So unrealistic nobody wouldn't do that on real life unless they can land on the ground safely. I feel like I'm the only person in the universe who's smart enough to know how fake this movie is, people acts like they did all this in real life when they didn't. Also it's lame how their character won't die as if they are immortal which isn't possible in real life. It so easy to not die in movies it's like Call Of Duty where you can't die in campaign or else you're stuck in one mission and can't proceed."
1,"I never understood why this franchise always made so much money and why so many people like it. Unless you like to see half naked women sponging on wet cars, cars with modified engines used in street races (and of course it's all done in a team of outlaw guys, the so-called ""family"", against other teams with people with similar desires) and to escape the police (police haters, they should inflate the scores here in IMDb), and to illicit traffic drugs and money, this type of film is not for you.I have a theory of mine because this series remains strong in the box office and each film gets better box office than the previous film of this franchise. The secret lies in the breakdown of our society. When this franchise began in 2001, our society was morally not decadent as it is today, nor so violent. In the last 16 years our society has grown worse and the values ​​of the old days began to disappear and our society and the moviegoers in general began to identify more and more ,each time, with the ""characters"" of this type of film. This is the only explanation, which I see, because every movie this franchise has billed every time the previous movie.Not anything, in this movie at the level of content or structure that is worth as a film, whether purely as fun / entertaining or for possible logical/ make you think. Not a single quality exists in this film (or in this franchise, but actually beyond the seventh film, I only saw the second film in this series (which I consider absolute crap).Anything. Plot is not interesting, shallow characters like a plate, unless you like what they do. Characters with generic lines and say cool one liner to impress the younger ones. Bureaucratic action scenes - two guys jump with a sport car at high speed between two skyscrapers. The damage is minimal, almost non-existent. Ridiculous ending. Chiché story and action scenes without suspense, tension or in a interesting way visually. At least.A waste of time, at least for me."
1,"the first one in the series was okay > Five was great; but #7 was terrible. I didn't think I would ever see a movie worse than ""Santa Claus vs the Martians"" (The Waterboy came close) but this was a stinker. I was bored and saddened by the flimsy plot and lack of meaningful acting - but then what in the script called for acting. This film was so bad when viewed two years ago I haven't been back to a theater since."
1,"If I am being punked - this is the best punk ever.If aliens were to ever come and visit the earth and they were find out about this movie, the planet would instantly and rightfully be destroyed in response.Every single line in the movie must have been written by a group of 15-year-old boys. Yet each line is delivered with such deluded certainty that the cringe worthiness is somehow confounded upon execution.The camera pans across Vin Diesel's face on occasion, this is great because it gives the audience ample opportunity to see his acting abilities which are equal to that of a shovel. If I had paid $15 to go to the cinema and stare at a blank white screen for 140 minutes instead I would have felt much better about the money I had spent and the overall experience.I hope I am dead before Fast and the Furious 30 comes out.The only thing more disappointing than the movie is the fact that people pay money to see this, and some of these people are adults, who live among us, work jobs and have licences to drive cars. Cars. Cars that are made of metal that drive on public streets.Regretfully the majority of people who have seen this film have the ability to vote and unfortunately there are currently no laws in place to circumvent this issue.Not only did I lose 140 minutes of my life but after looking at how much money this movie has grossed, I now feel unsafe amongst my fellow human.Please put a stop to this franchise before another one of these abominable crimes against humanity is created."
1,"An action movie can indeed have a great story and balance. The best action movie ever, in my opinion, is Terminator 2. The action is there, but there are also moments of low-key scenes to build up the story. When the action scenes arrives, they are set in context with the characters and the story.Fast 7 have very poor story boarding and a even worse story. The characters are very shallow with few exceptions. Some scenes are very embarrassing to watch, and the dialog in ""romanic"" moments are stolen from an essay from ground school. There are almost no breaks between the action scenes, and the overall music does not match the scenes very well.Fast 5 was in contrast a far better movie with more self-irony and a more ""trustworthy"" story. I suspect they have tried to amplify Fast 7 to make it even more spectacular. They failed in my opinion. The best part of the movie is the very ending, but it is not in harmony with the rest of the movie at all. I was very furious after watching this movie - it is a waste of time and money."
1,"If you know anything about cars, how the Internet works, or can differentiate between real and cartoon violence, you will not enjoy this movie. Don't get me wrong, I love the corny lines and the Hollywood portrayal of the Cali street racing scene of the first Fast and the Furious movie but watching a fat Vin Diesel acting and dressing like its still 1999 just makes me sad. The storyline in this movie is so bad, I wouldn't be surprised if you told me Vin Diesel wrote the script in crayon himself. My expectations for this movie were extremely low. This movie makes Transformers: Age of Extinction look like Citizen Kane."
1,The dialogue is at a first-grade level or worse. Over-the-top melodrama and the acting is ridiculously awful. I honestly don't know how American cinema could dumb itself down any more than this.
1,"This movie is a steaming pile of manure which has put another nail in the coffin of car culture, I feel happy for Paul Walker that he's dead as it means he won't have to waste 2 and a half hours of his life watching this abomination.Vin Diesel said this movie would probably win the best movie at the Oscars, well he must be on some seriously good crack or PCP these days as he's completely delusional, this movie will more than likely win a Razzie if anything, I mean cars that fly??? holy s*%#!!! Having head on collisions and just walking away???This movie is made for 12 year old kids who have no idea what real car culture is all about, it might keep the flat peak generation happy but anyone with half a brain will be truly disappointed, if I could give it half a star I would"
1,"I am typing this out as I am watching this ""film"" and it is so completely seizure inducing and devoid of any plot or logic it's an embarrassment to legitimate films everywhere. An ADD movie for ADD audiences, I quite literally could not follow a single thing going on during this fiasco. The only .5+ is Kurt Russell my favorite actor giving a good performance to no avail sadly.This is my first 'Furious' film I have ever seen and I have to say my hands we're flying in the air the whole time saying ""what the hell is going on??!"". Impossible scenarios, indestructible human beings, zero humor, I felt like I was watching a 2-hour Snoop Dogg video. How about this gem for dialogue...Ludicrous: you said dibs what are you in the 4th grade? 5 seconds later...let's Rock, Paper, Scissors for it. Asinine!A true digital steam pile for the lobotomized, young, or immature to fully enjoy."
1,"I saw this movie tonight, at 19:00 at Event Cinemas. I was looking forward to this movie before Paul Walker passed. Prolonging the release was horrible, but I'm glad they took the time to finish the franchise instead of throwing everything together and calling it quits.The thing that stands out about the Fast and Furious (FnF) is how much the characters value themselves as family, NOT friends. The family aspect felt stronger than ever in FnF7, which brung Sean Boswell into play with Dom.With a different director, the action shots & camera affects were better than every before seen in FnF. Fight scenes were amazing, though they could never top Dwayne Johnson & Vin Diesel! ;) Tyrese Gibson kept the comedy going while Vin Diesel dominated the drama side of things, and of course the action. The action was amazing, as always, and the cars were just as fast. No let downs there!The most amazing thing about this movie, to me, was the archive footage of Paul Walker, which in fact was filmed by himself. (Some of it.) The last 5 - 10 minutes were the actors, relaxing on a beach, remembering Paul Walker, were they in character? That's up to you to decide.This franchise couldn't of been as successful as it was without Paul Walker. He was an amazing person, and he couldn't have received a more touching goodbye. Rest In Peace, Paul."
1,"I was looking forward seeing this movie. Simply because I enjoy action flicks sometimes -- because of the simplicity. But the dialogues are so astoundingly bad that I had to throw up after 9 minutes. Literally. Well, 10 minutes rest and I gave it another try. I have seen a short, very unrealistic action sequence (if Force still is the factor of mass and acceleration, the two guys must have been killed each other 3 times in 1 minute) in which 2 people finally survived an explosion plus the resulting fall of about 5 meters. Through glass of course. Followed by a cliché scene in which we learn about the pregnancy of another character. This. Is. So. Wow. Nooooo!!! What the hell??? Do it as I did: don't see it at all. These were the worst first 15 minutest of an action movie that I will ever see."
1,"But I'm giving it a 1, because of all the Walker Dead fans who upvoted. Will adjust after it's between that range. As for the franchise, it's flogging a dead horse. I mean they had started with drag racing, went on to drifting... this installment literally had cars flying EVERYWHERE.Smashing, jumping, flying, floating, cloning (Maserati), mating (Jeep?) cars... And The ROCK gets a car (sort of) too! Plot is par for the course, slightly dumbed down for the audience of today. (E.g. Kurt Russell's role and the MacGuffin tech nonsense)Overall, enjoyable show especially near the end where the action crosses into the ridiculous territory. Next installment, do F1 please."
1,"Plot: cars, cars falling out of aircraft, cars ramping between skyscrapers, bullet-proof cars, car races, fights, explosions. Pretty much all manner of random stuff involving cars, plus, to a much smaller extent, other stuff, with no real link between one scene and the next.As you can tell, there is really nothing plausible or even good about this movie. Just random action scenes, generally involving cars, strung together. Absolutely nothing makes sense, or even tries to make sense - the plot is that non-existent.Hammy acting to go with the lack of plot and torrent of ridiculous action scenes. Not that surprising, considering the cast. Kurt Russell is capable of a lot better though.Clearly made for people who just need explosions and fast cars to be entertained. Even a plot would be too much of a stretch for their brains. The producers must be laughing all the way to the bank - easiest money they ever made."
1,"The story is so plain obvious. The facts are not not researched properly. No surprises along the story, nothing that made me interest to keep watching. If I would not be so angry at how bad it was while I was watching I would have fallen asleep in the theater. The effect are great! And the acting as well, its spot on. But the story as a hole and the plot. If your an 3 year old you will surely enjoy it."
1,"this movie was damn trash, I had to sit there for 2 and a half hours just to cringe and sigh at everything. Yeah the movie had a nice tribute to it at the end, the CGI/animations and the special effects were great. But the whole movie was just so predictable, and the action scenes were highly unrealistic, for example around the end when Toretto and Shaw were fighting they were punching each other really hard, a normal man would not be able to fight after that, one of those hits to the jaw and its done for you. Another thing that made me sigh was all the cheesy one liners in the movies, when Hobbs was about to go kick ass he spoke to his daughter and he said 'daddy's gotta go to work', now I've heard that damn line around 7 thousand times in movies. Not to mention that the action scenes in the movie looked like they were written by a 8 year old. Jumping out of planes in cars? I mean really, it's basically impossible to do that with a parachute AND land on the road successfully. One of the dumbest parts in the movie is when Shaw and Toretto basically drove into each other, like what? that is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie, and the fact that they both just hopped out of the car, stretched some muscles and started fighting again was even more stupid, you wouldn't be able to do that in real life. And when Jakande was in the helicopter flying around in the city for about half an hour, you'd think the swat team would be on to that in no time, not just a few police cars. And there is no way that Hobbs could just pick up a giant machine gun and know how to use it, let alone stand in the middle of the road and start firing at a damn helicopter, like c'mon seriously people? I seen almost every review saying oh this movie was amazing and a touching tribute, but the whole movie was genetically manifested to just make money, and that's exactly what it did. For this movie I give the acting a 5.5/10 the effects a 9/10 and the story a 2/10overall a disappointing movie."
1,"Seeing this movie means that I will now have to go back and change the only film that I ever rated 1 star previously and give it a 10, because literally this film is so absolutely god-awful that it makes the worst movie I have ever seen previously look like pure gold.Let me be frank, this is not a movie. It's a cartoon with real actors. I understand this is not supposed to be realistic of course, but on no level at all can this be considered good. I mean it looks like it's been written by a sexually frustrated 13 year old boy who only eats sugar. The plot is so illogically ridiculous, so full of holes and nonsensical developments that it makes my three old niece sound like an astrophysicist. The action sequences are all totally pointless because in the end none of the good guys are ever in any danger whatsoever and I would not have been surprised even if Vin Diesel had taken a direct hit to the face with a nuclear missile and still walked away with a Hollywood smile. What's the point?Asides from the absolutely appalling plot, narrative, acting, the cringingly immature script, the awkwardly grotesque directing and the inane and utterly boring repetition, the 'film' manages to fill the moments in between explosions with shots of scantily clothed females lounging around super cars. Which just proves my theory that James Wan and Chris Morgan got the inspiration for this flick while they where snorting cocaine off a prostitute's butt, in a bed made of thousand dollar bills, while playing GTAV.But in the end I can't blame the creators of this junk-food film, because judging by the hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars it made they are actually making the kind of movie people love. Which, in the words of Alejandro G. Iñárritu, goes to show that, ""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige."" But if you do love this film then thats fine of course. As long you're 15 and under and you really don't know the difference between a film and a cheeseburger. Awful."
1,"This is actually man of steel movies without the costumes and henry cavill and zack and nolan!!!!okay.. so a nice action movie can be enjoyed even if the story is wobbly. but seriously.!!! we are not watching fiction here are we??.there is a 900 feet backward car tumble in a rocky mountain and vin diesel walk out unscratched@!!in the last scene he drives the car of a 6th or 7th floor parking into a chopper ( DIE HARD copy BTW), somehow manages to hang a bag of grenades on the chopper and then crashes down and walks again.i mean .. keep it real guys.also toooo muchh of action and action and actionnnnn and its actually boring.. its mindless. its like watching cockfights. the cocks are killing each other. they just don't know why.rock looks stupid.. biggest disappointment.If paul walker were watching, he wd go.. "" guys make a good movie that would make people remember the series . forget the last 5 minutes tribute to me.. Just rock ""just disappointed ..."
1,"How does garbage like this get a 7+ rating? This movie has several of my favorite stars, but it is one of the dumbest movies of all time. The special effects went so far beyond reasonable, that they just make you groan.Here is an example: The need to catch a truck, so they decide to get in a cargo plane. They drive their cars out of the cargo plane and parachute down to the road. While in the air, they are steering their cars to navigate them. All (but one for comical relief) land perfectly on the road.If people stopped watching trash like this, Hollywood would be forced to put out better movies. But as long as movies like this get a 7+ rating, Hollywood will continue to make dumber and dumber movies.Get real"
1,"To be honest I can only review the first half of this film. I am amazed that I was able to last that long. At that point I had lost the will to go on breathing.A whole lot of muscly men with mediocre acting ability (which is not stretched in this film), scantily dressed women, exotic cars and really juvenile dialogue combined with a plot that you could write on a postage stamp.If you can't tie your own laces or are out of your head on something this may be made for you. Otherwise steer well clear. It's not even bad in a funny way."
1,"I am a big fan of the F&F series & thats why i wanted to this movie to be somewhat exceptional, especially for Paul but this movie was full of unrealistic events. Surely, a lot of people would love to see cars falling out of the sky. Some might even love the special effects but I didn't. The stuns and most of the actions made no sense. Lemme explain why:1- The unrealistic stuff started from the parachute landing, i know that they did throw out cars from the sky for real but if you ever studied physics you'd know what would happen to a car if it falls down from sky to ground, even with a parachute! Also the way Dom went through from one building to another breaking glasses, made me think If I was watching ""Shaolin Racing"" a sequel of Shaolin Soccer. 2- Dom & his crew pull out that parachute stunt with the help of govt officials to rescue this hacker called Ramsey, but at the same spot Deckard Shaw appeared out of blue, without any problems. 3- When Dom & his crew went to that Jordanian Prince's mansion to retrieve Ramsey's chip, they faced Deckard Shaw again who appeared with a gun in his hands. The whole mansion was loaded with security officials thats why Taz had to hack their system so that Dom, Letti & Brian get to recover the chip, but Shaw was at his ease and appeared as a superhero.4- When Shaw threw a grenade at Hobbs, the whole apartment got destroyed buy at the same apartment Shaw was fine & safe because he was hiding behind a wooden table. The grenade that can destroy an entire apartment, can't cause damage to a table? Well Shaw didn't even get any scratches, his face was just covered with a little dust.5- When Dom followed and found Shaw, Govt officials came out of nowhere and intervened. Because of the govt officials Shaw managed to escape and right after that the govt officials asked Dom to catch Shaw with the help of God's eye. Why go through so much trouble when you could have already arrested Shaw? Couldn't you rescue Ramsey & God's Eye after arresting Shaw? Overall, Furious seven is a awful movie. And please, don't rate this movie high because of Paul, we all love him but please let's be honest here. Thank You"
1,"The whole movie just seem so fake, very poor quality of production adding Paul walker in was mistake, it didn't seem realistic at all.this could the worst out of all the movies.I last few seem to be quite OK ..above average But this just seem farcical.....almost couldn't watch it all.All the cast and crew should have said OK maybe we shouldn't release this.If they make another the need to go back to the other directors and james wan should stay with horror type movies.It was nice, the ending part to paul walker hope xxx 3 is better than this"
1,"First of all, I normally know what I get when I watch a movie. And I watched all F&F movies, so it wasn't that surprising. I've waited long to watch F7 'cause the hype was hard and every moron on the street praise the movie like it was the Passion of Christ part 2 plus the radio stations play this f***ing ""see you again"" song up and down. Let me sum it up for you, I hated this movie before I saw it. I put it in my watch-list and thought this would make a good Sunday afternoon movie in the near future.Yesterday was this special Sunday afternoon and my girlfriend suggested this movie. After 10min she was sleeping deep and I was alone with ""the family"". If she was awake we could joke together about the cheesy dialogue, the bad acting (and I looking at you Vin Diesel) and the pointless, very forced story line. I love movies with Dwayne Johnson but he couldn't save anything. I quit after 30min, cause I couldn't take it any more. The Vin Diesel scenes were so awful to watch, he act bad ass as f*** but looked like a sausage in a wife-beater with nearly no expression in his face.I never saw the high praised over-the-top action everybody is talking about but I don't feel like I am missing something. I don't give one star ratings (except this one time I watched 10min of the iZombie pilot-episode), so I scrolled through my ratings and saw my 3-star ratings for A Quantum Solace, Ghost Rider 2 and Transformers 3 and I finished all of them, this must be much worse.So here you got it, 2 stars, horrible movie. If you want to insult your IQ, watch it. If you are a 10-year old boy blackmail your parents to buy this waste of time on bluray, so you can trade it on lunch break for meth or other stuff kids in this age consume nowadays."
1,"apart from the tribute to Paul walker, there was nothing even remotely special about this movie. its a collection of car stunts, lucky accidents and girls in panties. the plot is based on finding Deckard Shaw (jason statham) but he is the one who mysteriously appears every where Dom goes. so why bother retrieving a device to find someone who is already following you. i just can't believe this major flaw in the story. this whole cliché action and useless fighting makes no sense to me. the way they stretched the story just to add another action sequence in Abudabhi is really an insult to story-telling. the hacker gives the godseye to his friend and he conveniently sells it to one individual with whom there could be some high profile action involved with flying cars from one building to another and breaking glasses; all this is completely ridiculous. it may seem like a good movie to the viewers who watch a movie just to watch it; but not a single person who has watched movies with a class would like this movie."
1,"Putrid best describes this 2015 film. The plot is stated in one line and for all purposes, it is quickly forgotten as the film is 100% action packed with never ending sequences of fighting, cars flying through the air, shootings, house explosions, car chases, man versus man and woman versus woman in endless fights. It's just too much to see in nearly 2:15 that the film takes to unravel.As a result of all this, the characters can never be fully realized. They are basically people caught up in this very warfare enduring throughout the film.The film becomes tedious because you want more character interaction other than what I have described above."
1,"Saw an interview yesterday where some people says, that there is something wrong with the system, if Fast & Furious 7 isn't winning an Oscar for Best Picture. NO. This movie is awful! The only reason why it wasn't the worst was because of the excellent practical effects! The acting is really really bad and the movie is overrated because of Pauls death. Yeah he died but a lot of crazy talented actors died too in 2014 like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Williams just too name a few. I hate this movie and I highly recommend that you don't watch the movie.DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! IT'S AN AWFUL ONE! IF YOU LIKE TERRIBLE MOVIES WITH BAD ACTING AND DUMB PLOTS, THIS IS FOR YOU."
1,"The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$"
1,Yes Joaquin's performance is good and the cinematography is pretty but otherwise I do not get all the hype about this movie.Not for a long time have I felt like I would be better off leaving the cinema than staying and getting my money's worth.For something that was supposed to be gritty and real it had a lot of convenient scenes to help push the plot along.Very disappointed.
1,"I thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much. The character doesn't even stay true to the comics and the director flat out said it didn't, and then they made it seem like it was part of Gothams fall and he was just a little boy that had a laughing problem... Hated it"
1,Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds. In real life anyone else would quickly become non functioning but he seemingly becomes more normal.Consequently he goes from being a bumbling idiot to a highly skilled criminal. I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.
1,"I don't understand the high ratings. I went to the cinema with high expectations, only to discover that the movie was slow as anything and was almost finished before the first killing happened. It was a dreadful time having to wait for something to happen.
But yes, once the movie was finished and I finally walked out, I got the cosmic joke; I was the joker, trusting the reviews and leaving disappointed in disbelief I actually paid for watching it."
1,"Joaquín Phoenix's unconvincing laughing, and looking like a beaten dog had brutaly ennoyed me after 5 minutes.
The world is mean and bad, and you can only be bad and hit back. Chaos, anarchy, whatever .. inspires bye a clown who killed 3 bullies.
More of this stupid excess of brutality in the name of... what?
Yes. It is the same director as in the hangover 3.
I don't want to be a partir of this.
Brutal and boring."
1,Don't waste 2 hours of your life this movie is the baddest i've seen in a long time. Crappy writing and no good storyline...it was boring. I went to the pay counter to ask my money back for the 2 hours of torture...they can't do people like this. And for all the people with 10/10(the reason why i went) you're a  joke.
1,"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea. In the film, a band of Hollywood's most insipid producers, writers, directors and other such riffraff suffering from this ailment got together for a group therapy session, in which the therapist, a Hollywood mogul, had them 'let it all out', gathered the refuse and flogged it off for a few hundred million dollars.Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers."
1,"I'm keeping it short, the movie sucks.Yes, I know there's a need to build character and crap, and I think it's important for any good movie.Same goes with this, I get it Joker was a troubled man, I get his frustration, but I don't need 2 hours of the movie telling me the same crap over and over again.Give the guy an Oscar for performance but throw this movie into the trash right after."
1,"I don't write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people's heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else's critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho
King of Comedy
Fight Club
Taxi Driver
Dark Knight Trilogy
Dog Day AfternoonSo let's do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the 'Joker' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don't make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.
Zazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how 'masterful' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.
The inaccuracies are plenty as well.
Yes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It's simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.
How does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70's shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called 'social commentary' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let's protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it's time? Watch The Truman Show.
The sad pathetic irony of the causes of this 'unrest' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let's kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like 'wtf just happened?'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such 'deep' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it's a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?
And so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that's about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that's the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.
As Shakespeare should have said, ""To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question"""
1,"I have never left a review for any title, good or bad but this is such a piece of garbage that I registered an IMDB account just to vent my opinion.
I want these 2 hours of my life back"
1,"I'm making sure to give this movie 1 star because it's definitely not a 8.9 - that's a lie.Joker is not an amazing movie. It's far from great. More to the boring side.It lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development. How many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy?He suffers, gets fired, has a mental illness, nobody loves him, he's sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again. And he kills some people, and that's it, that's the movie."
1,"It seems like they were making a movie about psychotic killer clown and halfway during production decided to slap on a ""Joker"" title to make an ""origin"" movie about one of the most iconic villains of all time. They could literary change a couple of names and put the ""Depressed psycho killer clown"" as a title and it wouldn't make any difference. Well, at least i would give it a 5 out of 10 score. Maybe.Phoenix's Joker is stripped, sliced, diced, blended and strained to reduce him to only one of many aspects of character itself, insanity. Well that, and clown clothes. No other character traits Joker is famous, feared and loved for are there, and I just can't see them developing ever in this version of him. Even the movie itself is a slap to the one of the most important part of the lore and characterisation, Joker never truly revealed his true identity and even the three comic book versions of his genesis are probably all lies (well Jack Napier is just a shortcut for the story sake in first Keaton's Batman, movie-wise). Forget the deadly toys and gadgets, where are the genius intellect, prankster personality, wits, planning 5 steps ahead? True Joker is the driving force, this one is just a passenger in a cab (Taxi Driver pun intended). Joker would never pitty on himself, he does not laugh because he has a psychological condition and can't help it, he laughs because he is genuinely amused with all the terror and pain he inflicts, he IS truly a psychopath, not a person with some type of Tourette syndrome pushed in a world of murder and crime. And most of all Joker is supposed to be actually funny in his sick and twisted way, not only to himself (as Phoenix is) but to all of us. This is the first time i did not find anything funny in ones depiction of the Joker (well Leto's performance is a pretty good contender, but i won't judge him on the basis of 37 seconds of screen time lol, and even that was closer to Joker than this).As if you make a Batman movie where the Dark Knight is only left with his early fear of bats and mask with pointy ears, or the Iron Man where Tony is only a rich pompous jerk.And when Bruce Wayne becomes Batman Joker will be, what, 65, 70 years old?This movie doesn't work as an origin story, it doesn't work as a standalone (it's composed of only one really long act with a glimpse of a second one), nor as a part of DC in general. It is not an origin story we need, nor deserve, it simply isn't a Joker story."
1,"I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS"
1,"People are so hyped about it because it's so pretentious, that it makes them feel like ""enlightened"" ones. I haven't heard a good review of this movie from smart or intelligent people. Only those whose main movie list consists of actions and comedies call this a piece of art.A wife of a friend even called those who hadn't liked the movie ""lemmings"" but she's the one from the countryside who dreams of expensive brands and it actually made me laugh my ass out. Now you have an idea who this movie was made for.The plot is the main weakness. The Phoenix overplays and it feels uncomfortable to watch. The camera work feels very cheap and the overall boredom of the movie makes you start noticing all the imperfections. I would give it 5-6 out of 10 but there are too many pretentious dummies who gave 10 points so I'll even out the difference."
1,"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible."
1,"Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than ""One flew over cuckoos nest"" that shows way better cruelty saddens me."
1,"There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material. This film is little more than a remake of ""Taxi Driver"" with elements (most notably the end) borrowed from ""Network"".
In the case of ""Taxi Driver"" there are whole lines of dialogue, characters and scenes that are lifted from it and placed in this movie. Except the execution isn't as polished, the acting not of the same caliber and the story not as original.Watch ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Network"", this film was made 40 years earlier and was made better."
1,"Film was directed and produced poorly. Opportunity to take advantage of the incredible Joaquin Phoenix was blown.Gratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.Disappointing connection to viewer. Film was wandering for long periods. Tons of footage that should have hit the cutting room floor.I really wanted an stirringly creepy connection with Joaquin as Joker. It wasn't there.If you are looking for Joaquin moment like in Gladiator, you will be very disappointed."
1,"Disturbing. Just got out of the movie. My humor was much better before seeing it. At first feel pity for the guy suffering, but he lacks charm and then well he is just a killer. Heath Ledger was far better."
1,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ok, maybe not but they hype surrounding the movie killed it for me. It's not a masterpiece but an ok film. Why the one star? Way too many 10's! For once I actually agree with the actual critics who graded this film."
1,"This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!
Phoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!
2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!"
1,"I didn't spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé's audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn't get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I'm busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn't feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don't waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can't even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn't even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don't line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about ""The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile"". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn't do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it's not worth your time and money. if it wasn't for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would've walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I'd give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch ""Descendants 3"" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad."
1,"This movie was so boring, I kept falling asleep. I felt very awkward several times. My son & I kept looking at each other like should we just get up & leave? I probably should have. I cant believe some of the reviews on here. People have very crappy taste apparently. Just shows you, don't believe the reviews. If a movie speaks tour interest, go see it for yourself. This movie however, I wouldn't recommend. It's a total bore."
1,"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.
The script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.
As a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.
As for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in."
1,"Well at thirty years of age this was the first time my partner and I had ever walked out of a cinema before the movie had finished...As a petrolhead I should have loved this film. I know the story, I have seen the documentaries, I have watched the old films. An actor I had been working with mentioned it to me a year previously as he had landed a supporting role, I was excited by the prospect of a new film for motorsport fans such as myself. After seeing the trailer I remained excited, and yet slightly nervous about the handling of it.After the first twenty minutes I turned to my fiance and stated ""this had better improve""....after 45 minutes, I was ready to leave. We stayed for an hour as we had bought drinks and hoped things would improve. But there was simply no way I was going to make it through the full runtime of this movie.The writing and direction is just so cliche and cheesy, it wreaks of hamfisted Americanism, how people are claiming this will be up for awards is beyond me. It could have been written by a high school drama student. There were moments that were pure cringeworthy.I am deeply disappointed by this movie, I expected far more from everybody involved. Visually it's okay to look at, as it has the budget of a Hollywood Blockbuster. But beyond that, you'll be watching much of it through gritted teeth."
1,"Like many American films this title attempts to rewrite history.
The truth is that Ferrari were the complete underdog. What actually happened is that huge behemoth motor company Ford tried to buy the tiny Ferrari and Enzo said no. Ford threw their toys out of the pram and decided to build the GT40. With their limitless budget it took a few years for them to finally succeed at beating the tiny Ferrari company at Le Mans. And even when they did, Ford used a 5 litre engine versus Ferrari's 3 litre.
This film needs remaking to tell what really happened and who the reall heroes were. They would be wearing red overalls thats for sure."
1,"It is inherently uninteresting. A mega corporation gives a blank check to win a race, and they do. The film's crime however is it won't commit to this-Americanism is unfashionable today, so it wants it both ways, they're soulless villains same time as the Italians are othered bordering on Red Dawn-esque (for the crime of being a competent boutique car company?) Similar to First Man they hope no one will notice the misfire. Plus too many scenes of life lessons and a trademark killjoy biopic wife extend this half an hour too long...how many times can they bring out the exact same scene of Josh Lucas being a jerk or the wife being movie-wifey? But that is a great Christian Bale performance. He knows exactly how to register and where to pinpoint every beat. He's like the ultimate older brother. It's an example where good taste should have brought others into its wavelength, expanding why what he was doing worked and pulling the monotonous and contrived Josh Lucas nonsense they hammer into the ground scene after scene."
1,"I gave this a 1 start because of the historical inaccuracies. It would seem that a large part of their target audience would be race fans, and I hope they'd know this history. Just a couple of points ... it took Ford 3 years (not 2) to beat Ferrari, and, Shelby America came up with a system for changing brakes without changing the whole front suspension (which isn't what they showed in the movie). Sure, they changed out the caliper, but the rotor and caliper, and that was it. This seems like making a movie about the moon landing and claiming Apollo 10 got their first. If you're going to make this movie, get the facts straight."
1,Truly awful. A more appropriate title would be Ford: the meaningless death of Ken Miles. Nothing is done to make any characters meaningful or interesting. Ferrari is absent from the film almost entirely and Italians in general are portrayed as foolish caricatures. Ford management is made to look so dumb it is a wonder the racing program even existed. This movie is not fun or entertaining. Cinematically it is also a dud. I have never been so bored looking at a GT40. The driving sequences are nonsensical and without consequence. Save yourself the embarrassment and watch James May's Grand Tour GT40 film instead.
1,"I don't understand why this film is receiving so much recognition. It is a very bad movie with very mediocre acting (maybe even bad, cause too unrealistic and exaggerated), an unrealistic storyline, with dialogues that would never exist in the real world. I mean it's the classic american film that wants to glorify the american culture and all that. Maybe it was liked because of this. There are many stupid stereotypes too. This film don't deserve even a nomination at the oscars."
1,"Really low effort, made-by-committee fare with no soul here, sorry.Absolutely hated Christian Bale's character and his family. Bale played a Brit loudmouth with a temper, his wife and kid played stereotypical posh Brits with a heart of gold and zero personality. They all came across as phony. Every character in this movie seemed like they were playing their modern day selves, just on a sixties set with sixties clothing.Matt Damon basically plays himself, almost like he walked off the Bourne set and put a cowboy hat on. Bam, that' was the extent of his attempt to play Carol Shelby. Total joke, I wouldn't have paid him a dollar to play this role. They really could have found someone better.The movie was an hour too long. It was dumbed down for the Thanksgiving Dinner crowd. If you didn't see the documentary, you wouldn't know what was going on. There really was nothing about the engineering that went on with making the car. It was all about Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.Things about the movie were just weird. One character had a bubble jacket that I don't think would have been around back then. Matt Damon's character goes to meet Ken Miles' wife after a certain event, doesn't go speak to her...also, in spite of a tragic event recently happening, she and the kid act like nothing is wrong and life is great. It's really bizarre and lazy directing.I can't recommend the movie, it was terrible, sorry. The documentary is far superior. This was just bad."
1,"Disrespectful towards Italians; the writing around Ferrari is just like about Super Mario tbh; poor, cheesy, childish; maybe Hollywood should keep its mediocre movies made exclusively for patriotic and nationalistic reasons, to Americans only. Also, I thought Bale was exquisite playing the mad boxer part a while back, which earned him an Oscar - he tries the same here, but soulless. Should have the option to give it zero."
1,"This movie deserves no awards, no nominations, no high ratings. Waste of time. Probably they paid a loooooot in promotion. Comes to show you AGAIN to not trust critics. Embarrassing at least. I didn't know the story and during the entire movie I was wispering ""America First""... Hahahaha. After the end I ended up saying ""... and Second and Third"". MAGA people will love it"
1,"If a movie gets that kind of budget and actors, you get punished with a score of one.
This movie only made it passed the 20 minute limit 'cause I was thinking about what to watch next.
I was immediately irritated by Bale's performance, and Matt Damon's character looked flat, boring, just doing his lines while trying constantly to put on his American charming smile. 5 minutes later I was done with this movie. Too many reviews promise a thrilling experience from beginning to end, don't go in with that expectation, and maybe you'll make it to the final lap."
1,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a film about speed. And yet somehow, the filmmakers seem clueless about pacing and holding an audience's attention. With a run time of 2 hours and 32 minutes, the film seemed interminable due to the long, padded scenes stuffed between the race car sequences.The main problem with the film was in the character developments, which were one-dimensional and lifeless. A chorus of executives at the Ford Motor Company were an indistinguishable set of cookie-cutters. Incredibly, the visionary Lee Iococca blended in with the others, and it was never explained to viewers the genius of Iococca in the development of one of Ford's all-time best products, the Mustang. The one-note authoritarian dimension of Henry Ford II wore thin after his first scene, where he berates assembly line works and dismisses them for the day.The two principal race car drivers were also a sorry lot. Matt Damon dials in his performance of Carroll Shelby, a washed-up driver with a bum sticker, who is the liaison between the Ford executives and the world of the speedway. Christian Bale plays the role of driver Ken Miles as a down-on-his-luck schlub with an attitude. The maudlin scenes between Miles and his kid were a pathetic showcase of parenting, wherein the values taught to the little boy are that being a reckless hothead in life somehow pays off.The sappy dialogue of Miles and his long-suffering wife and the smarmy banter of the Ford executives bog the film down. Even the racing scenes were not as good as those crafted for ""The Art of Racing in the Rain."" From start to finish, ""Ford v Ferrari"" is a snoozefest and one of the most overrated films of 2019."
1,"In this movie they lie by two phases:
1. ""This guy went from France to Berlin"". The truth is Americans never reached Berlin.
2. ""Rusevelt beat Hilter"". The truth is Russians beat Hitler.
Conclusion: this movie is propaganda and lie."
1,"I really like both Matt Damon and Christian Bales earlier work.
But this was just horrible. What a nightmare to watch."
1,"One word: boring. Whoever thought this was a good idea for a movie should learn programming computers to perform specific functions. They should certainly never work at anything requiring interaction with the public. No good guys, bad guys, twists, or payoffs on the supposed expectations. I don't viscerally hate many movies. This is one. I usually like Damon, Bale, Berndahl, and many of the other cast. I had to force myself to sit through the whole thing. If you really want to check this out, wait for free streaming somewhere. This is clearly one of those movies that critics are pushing to demonstrate their ""influence"" or get paid, and there are so many fake 9/10 and 10/10 reviews here it's hard to trust IMBD anymore."
1,"This flick has so many flaws. Zero heart. It's difficult to care for any characters, especially Ford II, he's portrayed as a hollow man so when the actor does a poor job, the result is a bad movie. The film correctly illustrates all the reasons United States is hated by nearly every nation, corporate greed. Foul language omission makes it an ok kids movie. Adults will walk away feeling empty."
1,"At about 11am the guys all decided to turn their engines off and give away all their cash to ignited gasoline. The day ends at Denny's. One of the racers sits at a table with a huge picture laminated on the surface. Pulls a huge piece of black paper out of his pocket, un-folds it, and covers the table. He is then forced to peek around the corner, only to see the same picture on a t shirt worn by a laying down 900lbs dog."
1,"0 stars, shame of you americans. Garbage movie,
srriously"
1,"I see a lot of cliche.. drama which slows the movie & didn't connect me with any of the characters.. the end was super duper stupid..
Why is there a good or evil? Everyone's in a race..
And movie made me to think - why people spend billions of dollars for a race just for fun robbing oil from other countries? Lol!"
1,"Picked this up at the Redbox because it has such great reviews. Good cast. It's OK for some, but I was bored. to. death. I really should have known better.It's just car racing like the trailer trash flocking in the red hot sun at NASCAR, hoping to see a flaming horrific accident. '
Meh!"
1,"Had to turn off after 20 minutes, perhaps it got better. Christian Bales accent was joke. I wondered why they didn't just get an English actor to play his character until I found out he is?? Pathetic."
2,"If you don't like to think at all while you watch a movie, this movie is for you. Their stuns and most of the action makes no sense, unless this movie is SF, and they have super powers.It also makes no sense how they shoot with so many bullets that don't get to the target even if if so close! It's also pretty lame how they make the bad guys so stupid (they shoot with 'canons' using bullets, but they don't have a grenade or something to blow the cars that follow them?! really now.And many stupid things, like simply 'holding' on to the windscreen while the car was in move, staying on your feet in a fast moving car with rough terrain? jumping from a car to another while moving? Cars jumping directly on a drone? Falling with the car so many times, getting hit badly, but never getting hurt?Their lines are also so low, with no sense of humor or intelligence.And you rate this movie for it's final scene, you give this movie a high rating because of Paul Walker? you should rate the movie, not the tragedy..."
2,"THE Fast and Furious franchise is back for the seventh time, but without Paul Walker, who died in a car crash (ironic, isn't it?). It was nice of Vin Diesel to name his newborn daughter Pauline in honour of his former friend.The film carries on with the theme of family. It's not every man for himself, but it's every man for this multiracial family.Furious 7, however, is stuck in first gear and never gets going. I felt bored and restless in the first few minutes and hoped that the action scenes would rev me up. However, despite all the hullabaloo happening on screen, I never felt excited or bothered by it.One reason could be that viewers would have seen all the action before. The prerequisite implausible car scene, involving freeing a beautiful hacker, is more than viewers can hope for, but a voice inside them will tell them that science fiction films are more believable than this.Furthermore, the film let the cat out of the bag by showing this scene in its trailer, thereby removing any iota of excitement.Diesel, who's also a producer of the film, is still the glue that holds this motley crew together. His tough-guy persona is wearing thin, as is his ability to take hits from bad guy Deckard (Jason Statham) and the number of times he survives car crashes.His Dominic Toretto is gruff as ever but I didn't empathise with him as much as I did in the sixth film of the franchise.Walker, who died two years ago in speeding-car accident, is gently pushed aside as Brian. Dominic tells Brian that the bravest thing the latter ever did was to be a father to his family. Such a sombre scene requires time for it to sink into viewers, but in the next scene, we see bikini-clad women strutting their stuff in Abu Dhabi.Has anyone noticed that this franchise's preferred way of filming sexy babes is something that I call below-the-butt eyeline?Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) looks hot wearing a red gown and duking it out with another babe.Roman (Tyrese Gibson) cracks jokes and Tej (Ludacris) provides the necessary IT support. They briefly fight over sultry hacker Ramsey (British actress Nathalie Emmanuel) and just when you thought that they'd argue over her brains, Malaysian-born director James Wan lets viewers ogle her in her black bikini at the beach.The film's preposterousness reaches a new level with a sports car flying through three high-rise towers. Even if you had wanted to gawk at its silliness, the film took that away by showing it in its trailer, too.The ending, which takes place in downtown Los Angeles, is the final nail in the coffin for the film. An armed helicopter can wreak havoc with nary a sight of US jet fighters intercepting it. The police, meanwhile, are inept because they can't stop the accidents caused by car chases.By this time, however, I just wanted the film to finish so I could get out of the theatre.1 out of 5 starsabigspark.blogspot.com"
2,"I love blockbusters but I don't love this one.Furious 7 is a sexist, racist, trite film that does not even amount to the levels of The Avengers - a film it tries very hard to be. But even as a blockbuster with hundreds of millions in funding where we might forgive the rampant presence of -isms (seems backwards, doesn't it?) to please a general audience (falsley presumed to be White, Straight, and Cis-Gendered), we find ourselves in nothing but muck.In the first 15 minutes, we're subjected to women as props being sprayed with water with as little clothing as possible. Equal opportunity to delight straight female viewers or gay men is forgotten entirely as the objectification of the female props decorates the set. Did Vin Diesel and manage to negotiate as a producer that he could gain 20 lbs and not take off his shirt at all? Were the producers simply frat boys that don't know how to make women into 3 dimensional characters and scream ""eww!"" at the sign of male cleavage? Probably.If that isn't enough, Iggy Azalea, the very symbol of White people pretending to be from the streets, makes a pointless cameo with a terrible American accent and the entire movie is a setup for a letdown right then and there.Furious 7 delves deeper into its own chasm of stupidity by tokening its characters - good guys and bad guys. Roman is used is as the sassy black woman and Letti is turned into a practical girl from a novella (""I have to find myself, Dom!"" *tears in her eyes falling to her booty shorts.) When it comes to the bad guys, you have the token Asian that knows martial arts and the token black guy that's a terrorist. Djimon Hounsou is wasted in this film.The only characters worth their salt are Dom, who doesn't exactly evolve but does have a character arc, and Tej (played by Ludicrous) who's character is not simply a witty black man but a competent hacker with good insights.The globe trotting film however makes a very disastrous mistake by portraying Abu Dabi infactually with women walking around in bikinis. Any individual with vague knowledge of the world knows that this is a country where women wearing a bikini is basically illegal and will get you thrown in jail or fined. A simple fact checking might have saved the film this humiliation.But that's the essence of the film. Silly and sometimes terrible writing. Even as the film attempts to assemble a bountiful team of amazing drivers and skilled fighters, all of the one-liners fall completely flat. Take for instance Hobbe's one line to Letti during a confrontation. ""Woman. I am the calvary."" Maybe it was Dwayne Johnson's delivery, or maybe it was the 15th failed one liner in a row, but it was awful.The only reason this film gets two stars out of me is the amazing tribute to Paul Walker and all the fake outs of his character's death through the film. Without it, the movie would be complete trash. Actually, it is trash, it just has a great tribute at the end which is surprisingly affective."
2,"GOD this movie was terrible!!First of all, it was ALL action with the most generic and cheesy plot line ever. Like really, some guy wants to find some chip which gives you ultimate hacking abilities and it's oh so powerful? PLEASE. That is incredibly dumb and cookie cutter and like, there's literally nothing original or interesting about that plot a LOT. Way to fail in originality. Secondly, the action scenes themselves were dumb and defied all physics. Like actually though. The scene where Paul Walker is trapped in a bus that's very obviously gonna fall off a cliff, and he manages to climb it and survive because the chick just HAPPENED to get there in time? So stupid. Also, CARS FALLING FROM A PLANE AT A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE AND THEY ALL SURVIVE AND HAVE NO IN JURIES? What??? Like with that speed..and having their windows open like that, it makes literally no sense. Like, they would've DIED!! It was really stupid. There were several more action scenes and fight scenes that made no sense (such as the car going through three buildings in Dubai), but I'm not gonna name all of them. They were just all dumb and shot for people with no brains and who like movies that are all about ""the spectacle"" and not about substance whatsoever. This was a movie made for stupid people or people that hate thinking when watching movies, and don't critically analyze life. Literally, the kinds of people that are basic as hell.Also, oh my god, every character had the WORST one-liners and on top of that, there was this cringe-worthy ""family"" theme that had no actual substance. It was like the directors were trying really hard to get feels out of the audience, but with terrible one liners and a cheesy plot line, it was just so bad that it was actually impossible to feel anything other than sourness and cringe when watching the movie.ALSO, what the heck, the amount of testosterone in this movie is actually ridiculous. Like, objectifying women from the opening scenes. Way to market to your male crowd by reproducing a patriarchal bias. Ugh and it was so disgusting when the hacker girl was being treated as a sexual object by two of the main characters. Furthermore, i love how the two main female characters are SO dependent on their male counterparts. Like, one girl is pregnant and doesn't want to tell her husband because apparently being pregnant is too much for him too handle? And she deals with it alone because she's a woman right? And then of COURSE the other chick who's actually involved in action-packed scenes has amnesia and relies on Vin Diesel's character to find her self-worth and reason for doing things. Honestly i could go on and on, but everything about the movie was so dumb. Like it was the most mindless piece of crap seller-movie that I've ever seen *cringe*. Literally making use of ""The Spectacle"" and the fact that people actually want this to win an Oscar for Best Picture MAKES ME LAUGH. That's actually the dumbest thing and most laughable thing I've ever heard!"
2,"I think this movie is taking advantage of Paul walker's death, the storyline is non-existent (they save Ramsey from the black guy, and she tells them that the drive with the program is in abu dhabi, there is not connection from azerbaijan to abu dhabi, they meet directly with the other hacker, they enter directly in the party)the characters are stupid (vin diesel doesn't talk he only is speaking in quotes, kind like David caruso in csi Miami, Paul walker is in CGI all over the place, because Paul walker is in CGI, all the actors in the movie are a little cgi like in 300. To much action, very little logic in the action. So at the end i give 2 as a grade because the movies was very very bad, they were sure that they will make money when Paul walker died. they were sure that everyone will go see the movie."
2,"So, the gang is back and going faster and more furious than before! That's basically it!I don't really know what they were thinking while writing the script but it is really awful and thanks to the circumstances Paul Walker will not be appearing in any of the following furious disasters.I have seen worse movies but this one is a bad movie with a huge budget and no plot.Without saying anything bad about the actors, there is something about the movie that just seems really wrong. They just make every stunt performed look way too easy and going in and out of a foreign country is just a breeze. Authorities are absolutely clueless most of the time and just let the good and bad guys shoot each other and drive off. Gravity is a thing for people with normal jobs and why drive on streets while you can simply hit it and fly over.I am definitely not recommending this title to anyone. Skip this movie if you can."
2,"I never wrote a review before after watching movies all these years,this one completely disappointed me after seeing the reviews and ratings and how famous the movie was. The movie starts off well and the first 15 minutes good, but after that unrealistic things started happening, Rock falls off from building holding a girl,cars falling from helicopter, driving on cliffs, jumping from cliffs and all that within the first half of movie, wont talk about the second half. Just to mention there's a huge difference in realistic stunts and stunts they showed in furious 7. Talking about the action and plot of movie, it got worse. A assassin with a lot of skill and special agent from government messing with street drivers while government agencies cant catch him. All of them destroying people property and buildings like 911's happened,with the drone behind their cars and public feels normal and nobody asks nothing except for two police cars that tried to chase them once and wait doing all of that none of the person dies in all this action. Besides the Unrealistic stunts in the movie, there are various technical flaws which made it worse like Rock recovering so soon with broken leg and arm, when leg takes more time to recover specially if its broken in 3, he was running with heavy machine gun in streets by the end of movie and Vin diesel was flying his car to touch the helicopter. I mean Com'on is it a movie or joke as humans cant do this and this wasn't a animated feature film also.To Make it short, if you have been watching good movies for sometime and know what are stunts and what they did in furious 7, you definitely wont like it as none of it made any sense."
2,"There was nothing new in this movie, same type of old techniques and impossible actions, which are not really possible ways, its kind of funny to me. Jason Statham was definitely good addition, He done his well & done with his style. For Paul, We will miss you for the next one, But i think story is end here no more sequence we need on this 'Fast & Furious' or at least change the actors.I'm not really happy with this move at all :( This is what i feel so far after watching movie."
2,"From start to finish this movie does it's best to be cool but misses it's mark time and time and time again. Preposterous plot lines and awful action scenes make this celluloid drivel a yawn-fest! Aimed at teenage girls who miss the point and soppy- eyed teens who fancy Paul Whattsisname , it relies on slow motion action sequences that obviously make it easier to take in ! I gave this a 2 because in fairness a whole lotta people worked their butts off to bring this off! I'm gonna keep this review for ""Fast and furious 8"" because its going to be exactly the same as this and the last 6! Forgive and forget says the bible,,,ill forget but i really cannot forgive!! Awful in the extreme!"
2,"I found myself rooting for the bad guys to just kill all the good guys.This thing dragged on for hours and was just horrible.There were a few cool action sequences no doubt, but that is all you are paying for.All the characters are just not human, I mean how many times can your car drive off a mountain and you just walk away with no injuries lol. How many times can you just jump out of speeding cars and not crack a nail..I know its a movie but come on...How about having an insane chase, driving to the middle of nowhere and then all of a sudden swarms of swat teams just appear out of nowhere to save the day ( just in the nick of time)! Just so dumb I could not handle it.The tribute to Paul walker was the best part about the whole movie, and that comes at the very end..."
2,"This film has got to be one of the worst that I have ever seen. Apart from the tribute to Paul Walker the whole movie is absolute garbage. The action is completely unrealistic and I found myself laughing at its stupidity. James Wans' favorite way of showing us women appears to be showing us what is going on below the waistline. Everything about the film is cringe worthy, especially the dreadfully written script. There are so many clichés and cheesy one liners in this film that you end up annoyed. Vin Diesel's acting is unrealistic and laughable. The movie is far too long and appears to heavily rely on unrealistic action. Plus - Tribute to Paul Walker Minus - Everything else"
2,"This movie was simply ridiculous, i mean the PW tribute at the end was very nice and heartwarming but this movie.....The main characters suddenly were given the decision-making skills of a four year old to enable for the director to put as much of demolition, racing and explosions in this movie as possible. I've always enjoyed the F&F movies but this one was just too ridiculous, stunts went from highly unlikely to straight out impossible in combination with the fact that a team of 10 soldiers suddenly can't hit one single guy standing out in the open with automatic rifles and later in the movie when it IS convenient someone shoots a f*cking hand grenade over a distance of more than 200 meter with a f*cking handgun not to mention how that f*cking thing got there in the fist place!!But sure don't believe me, go see for yourself and end up in a mental hospital, like me."
2,"Once a simple race car drivers have become a team of superheroes, each of which owns a karate skills hacker and billionaire. Michelle Rodriguez, of course, a strong woman, but watch as she wins Gina Carano and Ronda Rousey, without laughter is impossible. Tony Jaa also appeared jumpy dummy without any achievements. Only Joe Taslim pleased in the sixth series, wiping the floor in the subway a couple of stupid morons. Actors do not play, and all go with a straight face, sometimes showing a light anger. There is no drama. Here there is no one to empathize with, no one to worry about. The characters are so boring and flat, that their cars look much livelier. Big-set of tricks and special effects, stupid and illogical, like all such movies. People eating."
2,"The most recent production of the Fast and the Furious franchise does not bring anything new compared to its predecessors. The moments of action are equally interesting, intense, furious and fast as in other movies. And so are the characters. As for the story, it doesn't really matter in this film. Seems like it would be there just to provide a decent separation of Paul Walker. And it manages to do so. He gets exactly what he deserves. The Director uses some interesting techniques. It is obvious that he has been inspired by the many successful films of the genre action-thriller for the production of this film and he tries to emulate them in a discreet manner. There are some memorable moments in this film. For example I will never forget the skydiving cars. But there are some moments that are not plausible at all, for example, a man who has no scratches after he falls with his car in a gap of at least 500 meters. And this is not the only scene full of mistakes. There are many similar moments that make the film look as if it had a budget of $ 1 million, instead of $ 250 million. It is easily seen that the Furious 7 is directed by an amateur. Too much money from the budget have been allocated to the actors and too few for the filmmaker. In conclusion, this film successfully manages to bring quality action to the big screen, but overall it is a mediocre film that does nothing original to the film industry."
2,"This is yet another crappy FaF film filled with unrealistic stunts and American patriotism. Corny dialog, terrible story and terrible characters. I can't see how anyone in there right mind can enjoy this utter tat. All it is, is explosions, woah, butts, yeah, 'Murica, F*** YEAH yet somehow it still receives 7.7 on IMDb. When I went to see i sat down ready to see a bad film but the level of stupidity in this film, there is a scene where Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson rips a mini-gun off an attack helicopter and then carries it around and uses it by hand, and this is after he had his arm broke. Speaking of his broken arm, he sees some action on the news in the hospital stands up out of bed and bends his arm to make the cast break of he then proceeds to use the mini-gun. I mean for god's sake that's not possible. There is also no laws of physics in the Furious universe so don't expect any realism. No one important dies in the film and at the end there is a tribute to Paul Walker which sadly did not last long enough to bring any real emotion, it's about 1 minute of Vin Diesel having flash backs."
2,"The biggest problem with this movie is that any plot in there was written around the crazy car stunt ideas they had.Jumping with the car between skyscrapers? Awesome. Moving between cars while spinning at high speeds? Cool.How about parachuting with the cars? realistic? of course not. It's not even original (there was a car ad that did the same stunt). These stunts are crazy and fun (so what if none of it is realistic).I just wish they could create a plot that makes sense around it.They got the brother seeking revenge as the main bad guy. In Die Hard with a Vengeance that idea worked great to justify McClane's involvement (because really, how does that s#$@ keeps happening to him?).The problem with that plot is that there's not enough there to justify two hours of crazy stunts. So a secondary plot is introduced. The team has to rescue a hacker and find a device that would help them track down the revenge seeking brother. That would have worked, if that bad guy didn't show up at every location. He shows up every single time and instead of trying to get him they try to escape. This movie makes no sense but the stunts are fun. Just ignore the dialog and any attempts at a plot and maybe you can enjoy it.This movie made a lot of money so another is probably on the way. Hopefully they'll use some of that money to hire a real screenwriter"
2,"After Fast 5 came out, I thought it wasn't possible to make a more terrible movie, but then they made fast 6. Now they've out done themselves once more. This movie is dreadful. There is not a single racing scene (unless you count the race wars drag), every action scene is extremely unrealistic, and overall the film is simply a failed amalgamation of every possible action movie scene. The first few films worked because of the street racing and the culture. The acting has always been bad, but no one really cared. Cutting the racing scenes along with trying to turn the franchise into a series of heist movies is really what soured the Fast and the Furious for me and really any one who likes good movies. Adding D. Johnson and J. Statham was simply the icing on the cake. Don't waste your time with this movie. The potentially best part of the movie was when Dom meets Sean in Tokyo, but the drifting scene through the parking garage is not shown. The only positive of the movie is the sound track."
2,"This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Unless you are a 13 year old boy, or have the mind of a 13 year old boy, you should avoid this movie. The script is absolutely horrible, the acting is bad, and the plot is designed for the sole purpose of adding more explosions, unrealistic car chase/jumping scenes, and random scenes of girls in bikinis. Suspension of disbelief? More like expulsion of disbelief. I've never seen anything so cheesy. The lines sound like they were stolen from a video game script. The movie panders to teenage boys who have not learned the general rules of physics or had the opportunity to appreciate the shape of a woman. It should appeal to no one else. I watched this movie with friends at my apartment and half of them walked out to another room because they couldn't stand to finish it. I finished it simply because I usually trust the reviews on IMDb and thought it might get better. I was wrong. The movie is nonsensical. Don't waste your time or money. The only decent part of the movie is the tribute to Paul Walker at the very end, but I'm sure you could see that on YouTube or just skip to the end of the movie to see it if you feel the need. This movie is way overrated on IMDb. Go watch Interstellar, The Martian, or Inception for a third, fourth, or fifth time instead. They are more realistic anyways."
2,"This film is absolutely awful. No amount of stunts, explosions, car crashes and shootouts hide the fact that the plot makes absolutely no sense. The fast and the furious started out as a semi believable film about Street racing. Seven films in and the only way you could explain the time line between those two films is if it turns out Dominic hit his head at the end of the first film and we're experiencing his wild coma induced fever dreams. It's honestly sad Paul walker died whilst production of this film was wrapping up but don't let the fans of the series inflated review scores talk you into watching this film. Do yourself a favour, watch the first one and pretend there aren't any sequels."
2,"I never expect a lot about fast & furious movies but this one is really poor. The storyline is flat. And It's far far beyond physics... Oh my god, please end this crap !This is always the same thing during the whole movie... and it is so boring !Action ? OK, that is all there is in this film with a lot of special FX... this is not how film works.And about the cars... I guess I will never get used to all those incoherences. Even if I try really hard, you should a least respect the BASICS of mechanical engineering."
2,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** When I first started to view the movie, I thought that may be this time, they could have done something good, although I didn't have to wait much time to check that this movie wouldn't be that. From top to bottom by this movie we can assure that Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Vin Diesel are entirely made out of steel, since all of them fight take and gave some punches and kicks, on body and on the face, but the two only things that happened was a broken arm on Dwayne Johnson and a scratch on Vin Diesel face, after being beaten on the face by a steel stick!!! That's impressive and ridiculous. Not only that was really bad, they compile a whole bunch of stupidity and nonsense, I think that my ""favorites"" are by the end, first when the building collapses by the space where Statham is and the following scene where Vin Diesel can put the bag of grenades on the helicopter....Reminded me of an also nonsense scene of Transporter...Probably the presence of Jason Statham inspired that also horrible scene. In conclusion is a bad movie, with an awful story, really bad directed...A bad cinematic experience."
2,"This is a ridiculous film from start to finish, I can only imagine the high reviews are sentimental. The story line is terrible, weak and full of holes. It jumps all over, not flowing well at any point. The acting is also terrible, with maybe the exception of Kurt. Jason Stratham plays the same character as he plays in all his films, very poor as usual. However it is the over the top stunts and fight scenes which really ruin the film, truly beyond reality. How the film industry keep getting away with these high budget rubbish films is beyond me, and the actors should have a bit of dignity instead of a big bank balance. I hope they don't scrape the barrel with another sequel!"
2,"I am not a great fan of fast and furious series.I have actually watched only 2 movies of the series, and I find it completely non- sense. The movie has so,so,so many flaws! Either the director deliberately ignored them, or he is a complete idiot( or he thinks that the audience has no common sense at all) I will leave the technical mistakes for the time being. Focusing on the loopholes of the story.1) Wherever you go Deckard Shaw follows,Why need God's eye?2)Dominic and Co. enter the secured terrorist area by jumping from a plane by using their cars(okay I will broaden my mind and assume that this is even possible),but then, an idea crops in your mind,How did Deckard shaw get in there? 3) A drone is called in to kill some random people! This is unbearable!! IF you want to kill some random people on American soil, you do not use a drone! You do it by sending an assassin .Use a sniper rifle and kill them all! Kill them in their sleep! Why use a goddamn drone? And first of all you cannot enter a drone inside USA without the drone being destroyed by the US patrols.4)There are many such flaws.But these 3 are enough to make the movie dumb.And one more thing, the genre of the movie should be changed,it should be science fiction.Yes! science fiction, Dominic and his crew are invincible, whatever they do,not a single scratch on them.The movie is downright stupid and dumb.And one more thing! they are cashing on Paul walkers death! They have announced fast 8 .Its horrible so horrible ."
2,"A movie seemingly written by a ten year old boy. Everyone plays one dimensional characters that exist solely to drive the cars. I think Tony Jaa got paid more to appear as a nameless villain in this movie than he ever got for any of the Ong Bak movies. Jason Statham plays an evil version of his Transporter character, specifically because the Transporter character drove cars, like that's why he's in this movie cause the ten year old who wrote this movie was like ""who's the toughest car driver to fight the car drivers of Fast and Furious? Oh yeah J. Statham!"" It's a stupid car chase movie, there is zero plot zero creativity zero cool, it made a fortune."
2,"I call it profit pandering when all that the producers ask of the writer and director is to make sure there are as many formula scenes (movie history has proved these to be money makers) as possible to attract the widest audience. Check out the proof: 1. Prolonged close up shots of the rear ends (said this way to bypass Amazon censors) of bikini, barely clad, humans. Check! 2. Prolonged close up shots of the males who compensate for their small appendage (said this way to bypass Amazon censors) by over pumping (exaggerating) the male antlers (i.e. muscle). A skill acquired first by practice posturing in front of their full length mirrors. Males further enhance their displays by seeming to always be wearing tight tees (if at all) with small sleeves to promote those antlers. So much non- functional muscle that if they tried running they might outrun a sloth. Check! 3. Furthering this theme is the storyline of ""muscle"" cars accompanied by prolonged close ups of ""pushing the pedal to the metal"" and massaging the manual shift with the that standard coup de grâce - squealing tires. Oh, and the car drop from airplane - done before. Check! 4. Assault on bad guy fortress - done so many times in film it has actually become boring. Fight scenes - an Oscar for camera angles. Bruce Lee, if he could see this, would be laughing in his Lake View home. Check! 5. Dialogue? Written for that part of the audience that struggled to pass sophomore English in high school. Check! 6. Inject into the storyline the latest pop news headlines caption grabber - terrorists and hackers. Check!"
2,"Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren't superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie ""a masterpiece"" is that they can't qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it's a masterpiece. If you're lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won't be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema."
2,"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you."
2,"If you like movies with no story and 2 hours of blah blah nonsense, this is for you! It was by far the most boring movie of 2019. A Joaquin Phoenix who overjusts, he wants to look like Depp? Of course, I understand the story of isolation and the psychological side. But what makes this film so special that it deserves a score of 8.8? Because of Joker's laughs? Because he shot people? The dark side was much better worked in Dark Knight Rises, here we are in a dark register, gore, depressing. Strange that this film is marketed in the United States when we see that it prone the ideology of Marxism.
Only the Joker had a character development. All other characters are boring stereotypes that do not contain a single story.
The cliffhangers are all predictable!
To conclude, I do not see this Joker fighting Batman at all."
2,"This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial's story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker's history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This ""man"", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one."
2,One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.
2,"Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed
The acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until nowI would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it"
2,"Joaquin Phoenix does a great job with the part he was dealt - but the movie itself was very bad. Draggy, with truly shallow character development (he is mentally troubled and Gotham is a harsh environment, you dont need 2 hours to convey that properly...).Todd Phillips is clearly at a loss to convey deep ideas through film. The trip through Joker is cluttered with terrible plot devices that offer to lead the plot down an interesting path, but inevitably lead to the most predictable, uninteresting conclusion you could have predicted.Saving comparisons for last - this movie just doesnt do justice for the Joker. He is meant to be a villian, not someone who to relate to. The Heath Ledger Joker was dark, twisted, and yet there was still relatability in his madness, one could understand his motives despite their general lack of morals, however this Joker seems to just be grasping for your pity - to the very conclusion of the film where you wont be sure if the triumphant music is supposed to be ironic, or if you are really supposed to feel like Arthur Flecks story has arrived at its fated end - Im quite sure the movies creators dont know themselves."
2,"Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I've seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of ""Mental Illness"" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn't have been there at well. (As opposed to Where'd You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn't care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It's what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent."
2,"I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say."
2,Do not lead to torturing children (mother) nor murdering people.
2,"If you want to watch a superhero/villain movie, then go somewhere else. If you want to see a ""descent into madness"" movie, watch Taxi Driver instead. This is just that movie with more graphic violence and - oh yeah - instead of driving a taxi at the end, this guy puts on clown makeup.The movie was also way to political, and it's message is just the same rehashed junk you get from most Hollywood movies nowadays. Just with more graphic violence and - oh yeah - clown makeup.Phoenix does a fantastic job, which is why I gave this 2 stars rather than 1. But the movie is twice as long as it needs to be and is only half as good as it should have been. I'd rather take the 2 hours I sat through this to re-watch The Dark Knight, where we see the Joker that his movie should have been."
2,The depth of the story was lacking to much focus on such a short aspect of the jokers life and he became the joker there was not much of a journey. The constant musical score was over dramatic and did not add much to the film if anything it detracted from the movie. All the actors performed excellently but this is not a movie to be entertained by our top be taken in by all the characters as the focus is so much on one person without a real journey.This is my opinion as my partner really thought it was a good movie. In the end I could not wait for it to be finished I think the character of joker has been devoured from the comics and previous movies.
2,"Just watched the movie, and I had to make an account just to put it out there, after hearing tons and tons of praises, that this movie has failed terribly in living up to the hype! I know that my opinion is extremely unpopular, but someone needs to say it. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as the joker, in regards to his acting, but that is probably the only positive thing about this movie. And I believe that a movie needs much more than just good acting. This movie does not even have a proper climate, and is basically about a mental illness, where I feel there is no hint of the charismatic, sick and brilliant joker we got to see in the batman series!"
2,"There is a LOT of hype around this film, and a lot of people seem to think it's great, and whilst I agree Joaquin's performance is brilliant, I was bored stiff for most of this. The kind of film I'd turn off if it was on tv. I may have been harsh on the stars but I go to the cinema to be entertained and I was far from it. If I want art I'll go to a gallery."
2,"Excited by the many glowing reviews I sat down in my local Odeon with anticipation to watch Joker. Unfortunately it fairly quickly became clear that the Joke was on me. I feel like the little boy in the tale of the Emperor's New Clothes, the only one able to tell the truth about what I saw. Nothing but a gloomy, depressing character study with Phoenix trying and failing to hang on to the ciat tails of the incomparable Heath Ledger. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss. If you don't it will be two hours of your life wasted that you'll never get back."
2,"Throw a bunch of money at a great cinematographer and a great actor, then throw in some gratuitous senseless murder in a comic book universe and watch the fanboys drool. ""It's like Scorsese!"" Yes it's derivative, except made by the dudes who brought you Road Trip and Hangover 3. Clichés galore and hardly any suspenseful scene building. It's crap, don't fall for it."
2,"I don't get it. I think it's a case of ""everyone thinks this is great so I should too"". I was definitely not impressed."
2,"Basically a bad remake of taxi driver with bits of King of Comedy thrown in to replace the underage prostitute parts ... oh and lets throw a little batman stuff in there too to link it to those popular superhero movies .
problem is unlike Taxi Driver the main character is very unappealing , unlikable , and hard to sympathise with ... not just getting retribution on those who have wronged him Bronson style - he's more American Psycho killing basically innocent people for fun . Glamorising violence against inocent people by the mentally disturbed not a great message to be putting out there nowadays .
also wayyyy too much time wasted on Phoenix dancing and mugging to the camera - they could have cut out 45 minutes and still made the same movie just less long and boring ."
2,"I really don't understand all the hype over this movie. I found it to be really boring.. and by the end of this boring, very predictable movie, I felt as though I just wasted my time and money.The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the acting was good."
2,"I watched joker film at the cinema. The film was awful and unexciting. Although the film is absolutely awful, the followers are increasing to watch it. I wouldn't recommend it because that gave me a bad message that the society is a negative effect on behaviour's human, For example: If someone past negative experiences, they will kill each person them abuse, that whether verbal or physical abuse."
2,"Leading up to the films release it had high expectations and if im honest i was quite disappointed with the film, i felt like the storyline was pretty good and the acting although the long and boring execution of it is what killed it for me"
2,"Good acting but the most boring film I've seen in a long time. I was expecting a slow burner but Jesus Christ, the good scenes in no way over shined the rest of the film and when he finally became the joker he played him like a camp 3 year old, complete pretentious American garbage. Ruined the character for me, hope they never do a sequel."
2,"What a horrible movie, from minute 1 you knew what's going to happen at the end. Overacting job of Phoenix. Poor acting by rest of actors."
2,"'Joker' is a sick, disgusting, dark, evil, violent, total piece of scheisse. It will seriously affect emotionally troubled young people already pulled at by suicide, addictive behaviors, and hopelessness. It's like a 'Triumph of the Will' for nihilists. I would defer from voting for Joaquin Phoenix for best actor until i see video of his normal non-acting self...it may be he wasn't acting in 'Joker' at all and is one majorly screwed up dude. And, what a weird alien body. He's naked from the waist up a lot in 'Joker' and, from the waist up, is, let's say, disquieting. All taut skin stretched tightly over an alien bone structure. The bones stick up and out at odd angles, in odd places, like the exoskeleton of a medical experiment gone wrong. Not a single pleasant moment in the movie. Not a moment of joy, nor beauty, nor happiness. No catharsis from all the misery and violence, just a stomach churning emptiness at the thought that the last fifty years have come down to this, and this is a circle of despair. A movie without hope, without humanity, showing a world that no sane person would live in."
2,"Morally, I dislike the depiction of mental disturbances relating to violence.Filmographically, this movie tries to ""terrorise"" the spectator. Strip it from the terrorising narative and violence, the only thing left is a use of mental disturbances."
2,"From a production standpoint: this film is bloody brilliant. Expert craftsmanship all around from the photography, editing, acting. I imagine this was a very difficult film to make and was handled with expertise.The screenplay was very disappointing, however.The racing scenes are fantastic, but most of the non-racing scenes are just cookie-cutter and uninspired. If the racing scenes weren't so thrilling and engaging, this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on. There are certain themes and elements which James Mangold does so well-and you can expect to see them in this film-but they're never really explored with much depth. Themes such as fatherhood, sacrifice, independence in spite of authority, what a man must do to take care of his family, a child's expectations of their father; all of these are just lifeless, dead on arrival.There's one female character in the film and she gets to sit at home and be the supportive wife to Christian Bale's character. That said, this is one of Christian Bale's best performances. He steals every scene he's in-but, unfortunately he only is ever given the same 3 beats to play. How many times can you watch him get angry when someone tells him he can't do something? Entertaining as it may be, it grows stale after a while.The two-and-a-half-hour run time feels like three. Fantastic editing not withstanding, at least thirty minutes of the film could have cut. Cut this film down by thirty minutes, and you have a serious Oscar contender. Keep it the way it is, and you have a real letdown of what could have been one of the year's best."
2,"Ye Gods, what a dreadful film. What is that Christian Bale character supposed to be? That cockney accent (I think?)... Dick van Dyke springs to mind. And his 'missus' - coom in fora cuppa. But that doesn't go near explaining how dreadful it all is - the two cars racing side by side, for miles(!) with the drivers staring across at each other. Yeah. At two hundred miles an hour. And how many cliches do you want? Ferrari are Italian? Lets make all their team and mechanics, like.. excitable. Peter Sellers could have got the gig. And Ken is on the bus on the way to Le Mans.. it's France! Let's sit two nuns behind him. He gets off the bus. We'll have two gendarmes walking past. Christ, send for Sellers! Get him out that Ferrari gear. He now should speak like zees! I nearly walked out. Y"
2,"Stupid plot, labeling the characters as ""good"" or ""evil"" in a superficial manner. The main characters' victory is overrated, as the Ferrari team didn't even finish the race. Total waste of time..."
2,"Yes it is entertaining. But sooo cheesy. So corny. Really sick of cheesy American heroism movies. ""Lets go to war against Europe?"" really??? Why you would even remind about World War 2 in some racing car movie? Is it not enough millions of movies every year about a war? Can you leave this brainwashing, cheesy American patriotism out of racing movie"
2,Cliche-ridden yawn-fest.The storyline is predictable (even without knowing the true history) and hopelessly inaccurate (if you do).
2,"The real story is well documented
yet they had to invent and show things that never happened.Ken Miles raced Le Mans in 65
films says he didn'twhy , it's unnecessary, it adds nothing to the story but incredibility
The movie is full with such nonsense and it sucks"
2,"3/4 of drivers were from new Zealand.
Americans cant drive corners... ."
2,"Usual USA propaganda.
No mention of x3 new Zealand drivers..
Load of bullocks"
2,"Couldn't get past a few minutes. Just seemed stupid. Damon is a pain to watch. He's such a below average type guy. He seems like the butt of every joke whenever he's in the room. Bale just keeps playing the same character over and over from The Fighter. This was a really corny one. It transformed Los Angeles, but I just lost interest quickly. It's like a Disney movie almost. Might be good, but not my type of movie.2 stars"
2,"Bale's good. He plays the role, he's engaging. He's good.But the film..,,my god what a snooze fest. I love cars and I love car films but this is just slow, tedious and painful.Worst part is the American depiction of 'bloody English stereo bloody types cor blimey av a cuppa tea' so full of cliches.At the end of the day USA has never touched anything close to what the italians can build despite the outcome of the race.Boring."
2,"This film start with a car racer ""Carroll"" burn by the fire while racing, and the introduction of a car mechanic ""Ken"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Carroll recruit Ken to contend with Ferrari at Le Mans endurance race under Carroll and Ford company! Entire film quite slow and not intense! The conversation in the film also quite bored! The director keep overuse the radio broadcast scene and overuse of the close up face scene also make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Carroll and Ken fighting at Ken house and Ken's wife(Mollie) watching them! At the end, Ken idiotically slow down his car to let another two Ford's car won alongside him at the finish line! He eventually finish second place! Ken kill by a car accident! That's it! Another disappointed film! The high rate quite fake!"
3,"With his brother in a comatose condition in the hospital, ""Deckard Shaw"" (Jason Statham) swears vengeance on ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) and his team who put him there. Now, while this should certainly be a possible cause for concern to any normal person, the fact of the matter is that Deckard is a highly trained and extremely skilled professional assassin who has a terrorist organization at his disposal to help him out. Fortunately, Dominic also has some resources of his own with ""Luke Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) and a shadowy government official who calls himself ""Mr. Nobody"" (Kurt Russell) who have separate agendas which coincide with Dominic's plans to kill Deckard before he can kill them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this picture definitely had the talent to be a very fine film. Unfortunately, the director (James Wan) resorted to one preposterous stunt after another which made this film look rather ridiculous in my opinion. Having said that, those who are fans of this particular franchise will probably love this movie for the simple fact that it has plenty of action and some of their favorite actors. Unfortunately, the complete lack of realism severely damaged its credibility in my eyes and I have rated it accordingly. Below average."
3,"If you don't like to be challenged or intrigued by plots/characters, then this movie is for you. Because everything about Fast 7 is mindless, illogical and incredibly cheesy. Anyone with remotely any intelligence, will be frustrated by the poor writing, boring plot, lame characters and below average action. Half way through you forget why they're even doing what they're doing. They go through great lengths in capturing a device to locate someone who's not even hiding from them, all the while performing unrealistic stunts against incredibly stupid villains. A God awful movie which, unfortunately, will see an 8th installment very soon."
3,"Whole movie you can't understand why they are doing all that.They jump over there car over the cliff without even breaking a bone,they just move their shoulder and ready to fight again.Vin and his team can fight whole army but not a single guy.They burn half the city down(in reality if it have been done it surely going to kill millions of people) just to save their team.They found gun just like vice city(ending sequence by rock).Action sequence is good but bad storyline up wasted all of it. Rock role is limit to first 15 and last 15 minutes.Jason role is also brief but regular interval of his appearance is the only thing that kept you on the sheet.average acting of vin and rest of the crew including paul walker.Brick mansion is more more interesting than this movie of paul walker.A full thumbs down"
3,"Take all the cliche lines you've heard from other movies and join them together to make a script. Add in some wooden acting, unrealistic plot lines and some pretty terrible CGI and you get the Fast & Furious 7.Take it at face value - a noisy action film with fast cars, elaborate fight scenes (often so clear the actors are no where near making contact with each other), unnecessary bikini shots, and it's a film that is capable of wasting a couple of hours of your life. Treat it like it's a spoof on action movies and you might enjoy it.If it were a choice between watching this movie again or being locked in a room with violent cats...I'd take my chances in that room!"
3,"Watched this the other night, and I can't believe all the good reviews it is getting. I just oon't get it. I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece, I knew full well going in this was going to be a car chases and explosions thrill ride sort of movie. Well, we got the car chases and explosions, but for me there was no thrill ride. I found most of the stunts visually uninspired and boring, and in spite of usually being able to turn off my brain and go with it, in this case I spent most of my time shaking my head in disbelief. This was so over the top it made old episodes of The A-Team look like a documentary. It wasn't so bad I stopped watching, but the thought did cross my mind. To all the ""it is so bad, its good"" folks, I usually like that sort of movie, but I don't think this one fits the bill, and since I enjoyed Crank 2 I think that says plenty enough. If you dig it, more power to you; if you haven't been following the franchise, go re-watch the Transporter or anything else for your car chases and explosions fix and give this one a pass. A certain amount of hoak and cheese can be fun, this was just too much for me, and I'm not the only one."
3,"Fast and Furious 7 or' Spurious Heaven' in my mind is, for millions of viewers, obviously, a whole lotta car smashin' fun, but for me it was just a pile of silly. Give me 'Need for Speed' and 'The Beverly Hillbillies' for more accessible car 'grunt'. Furious 7 is an overdose of film, TV and genre mash ups. It is Jackass meets James Bond or The Avengers/Guardians of the Galaxy/ Superfriends/ Agents of Shield meet Blofeld/ Jaws/Zoltar ... So what? Well, the series started off creating its own genre. Cool hipster car hoons pushing hotted up cars to their limits with a few human rights issues covered along the way for some heart. This hopefully final installment forgets all that and tries too hard with a silly McGuffin; 'God's eye' that gives total power to whoever can access it with a nice girl/ hot chick hacker nerd. At least this 'Bond Girl' didn't have to be bedded by the hero to stay in the film. I usually love Jason Statham's stock character, but his supervillian was low level pantomime Terminator and was just irritating. Kurt Russell appears as an Optimist Primo type and kits our heroes out in wannabe transformer cars and we go from one really silly set piece to another. The Rock puts his best Hulk on for some biffo. And there's even a Shrek Donkey appearance. I took a nap in the middle from all the gun muzzle flashes and explosions, just after the Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol bit.The cast is all likable and it's great the gang is here for truly the last time but I wish the series had gone back to its roots rather than being a jacked up James Bond. The best sequence was the final one as a moving tribute to Paul Walker used the perfect metaphor for this series. It is a tragedy that he had to take a different road and we will miss him from our screens. Too much of a good thing? You bet your parachuting GI Joe cars it is."
3,"I sat down for 137 minutes to watch an awfully made film. The animation made me wanna puke especially the scene where Brian is running on top of the bus you could f**king tell that it was poorly made. Another thing why doe nobody bleed in any fight scene... COME ON!! REALLY? Dom drives down a cliff, the whole car is destroyed but he comes out without a scratch... REALLY NIGG*? The final fight scene Dom vs Deckard was like watching WWE! The most depressing fight scene... it was like watching Bambi's mum got shot in the head and Simba's dad getting kill by a herd of wild ox's.""Deckard Shaw is an ex-Special Forces assassin and a mercenary."" Yet a bold guy who drives for a living beat the crap out of him without any training at all. ""ex-Special Forces assassin"" yet he can't even kill a group of drivers.Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) bring a drone into the city and starts to blow shits up and destroys a signal tower, with all the sh*t going off in the city I didn't see one military troops in there. The drone destroyed every car it shot missiles at fut fails to blow up Letty car. WTF!!another thing the animation when Dom drives through the building really sickened me. Why? I mean come on, it f**king looked like Asphalt 8 game trailer."
3,"This was sad...not only because we know Paul Walker died a tragic early death, but because this franchise has run out of gas. It is the same tired over-the-top special effects and even more wooden acting. Love Dwayne Johnson, but even he couldn't pump any life into this pedestrian script. We have all seen it done before, and better. I repeat...This was sad...not only because we know Paul Walker died a tragic early death, but because this franchise has run out of gas. It is the same tired over-the-top special effects and even more wooden acting. Love Dwayne Johnson, but even he couldn't pump any life into this pedestrian script. We have all seen it done before, and better."
3,"I've seen the first movie, so i got this free premiere tickets so why not? I thought i was going to watch a cars movie...guess i was wrong.Looked like a movie scripted by 5 male teenagers on a hot summer afternoon, full of nonsense. I can't even describe, that would take hours to explain everything. I could talk about every dumb scene, but it would be too much of an effort, here's one:The Rock is on hospital because by miracle he managed to get harmed, after something, he breaks its arm's plaster by flexing it, gets an FBI bullet proof vest out of nowhere (because hospitals...) then drives an ambulance and proceeds to fall on the top of a drone armed with missiles, and naturally he gets drone's mini-gun. The amount of nonsense is so unreal i almost felt like leaving the cinema room.This was honestly the worst movie I've seen on cinema. Nonsense physics, nonsense ideas (How to get on the most private party in the world? You just need to get some invitations out of nothing), dumb fights, almost no races, hot girls to give credibility, i can't even explain everything in 1000 words honestly.The only decent thing i found was the final 3 minutes or so, the Paul Walker tribute, and that is worth of the 2 starts out of the 3 i give to the movie, that scene was really awesome and worth, that and probably one or 2 comedy moments.As for the rest, you can't even enjoy the movie, you can't fit it on the ""so bad it's good"". You can get more entertained watching transformers."
3,"Harsh OPINION incoming:This Movie was just plain cliché rubbish!. With CGI that falls well short of today's films and filled with 1 liners that would make any adult cringe. I even heard grunts in the cinemas and slight whispers of ""What rubbish"" echo throughout the night. Glad to see I'm not the only one with these opinions. Some people would say ""It's suppose to be like this, its and action film""! Well compared to the other 6 i would rate this one right down the bottom,:spoiler:Towards the end of this film where the drone came in and started attacking, i was looking at the exit door contemplating if i should leave or not... It was just dragging on so much that it makes you feel uncomfortable and constantly look at the time. I hung around just for the so called great ending with a tribute to Paul. I was fairly impressed with it and it was touching, easily the best part of the film BUT that still doesn't mean this movie deserves a 7!.I cannot believe this has a rating of 7!... Up there with Black Hawk Down??? NO WAY!More cheesy lines than a bag of Doritos.3/10 A Poor film that just seems to be rated highly due to one mans death. Sad? But true. RIP PAUL"
3,"Very disappointing. inferior in every way to the previous two. There was some crazy stuff in them, but nothing like this one. Not only was it ridiculously absurd many times, the action in general wasn't even done well. lots of shaky cam. the fights were hard to follow and didn't flow well with the different battles like they did so flawlessly in the others. You can easily tell it was directed by a different person. I looked up his previous movies he directed and most of them were horror films, including the first Saw. it tried to take itself too seriously and get too emotional. the rock was barely in it. that along with the characters they previously lost made this team a lot less fun than the last two. also in previous ones, everyone had their roles, with some overlap. in this one, everyone could fight and shoot. Statham was awesome as a villain but was very underused. And the other villain was stupid (2 viewings)"
3,"I have never wrote a movie review so far, but this film got me so ""furious"" after leaving the theater that I had to express my disbelief in IMDb. The plot is very, very weak, but given the franchise, this is not such a problem as we all are expecting more action, racing and effects than a good story. Yet they took the good things in the franchise way too far. The stunts are defying the law of physics and common sense in such a ridiculous matter that it is laughable instead of enjoyable. The characters are getting worse and worse with each movie, a bunch of racers and mechanics who fight on even terms with world deadliest secret agents or can hack everything. I don't know who decided that every character in the movie should be a super hero, but that decision and its execution were extremely poorly made. To the point where The Avengers is more realistic movie than Furious 7. The only positive from the movie is the Paul Walker tribute, yet this cannot justify the high score in IMDb or the movie as a whole."
3,"to make it really short ... this film unfortunately offers nothing except a lot of ruckus and noise and one explosion after another and ridiculously unrealistic action scenes. It's not even comparable with the other parts before. here everything was ascended, that action cinema and the special effects industry has to offer. way too much in my opinion to pay attention until the end.spoiler: it was for me in the whole movie, unfortunately, only a single scene that touched me ... the final scene, when the cars of Vin and Paul (who already couldn't play this scene) at the fork road drift apart. that was more impressive than all the noise in the film."
3,"They should rename the movie, ""Fast and Curious 7,"" because I still don't know what went on in the movie. I remember some Korean guy seeking revenge for his brother's death. The rest of the movie is somewhat of a two hour blur of gun fire, and muscle cars. There are some extremely hot characters in the movie; Nathalia Emmanuel, Tyrese Gibson, and Dwayn Johnson to name a few. I say Tyrese and Dwayn because my date kept moaning every time, Tyrese was shown in a scene, and off course, Dwayn, ""The Rock,"" Johnson's muscles protruded from every inch of his body. My knees went weak when I laid eyes on, ""The Gorgeous Michelle Rodriguez."" I have to give the movie 3 stars, because the producers of this movie was smart enough to hire, Michelle. If you go to movies just to see hot characters like the ones I mentioned this is the movie for you. But don't even think about looking at Michelle; I got dibbs.What went on in that movie?? Scratching my head."
3,"Which is worse, the writing (which is borrowed from a hundred other movies) or the acting (this crew has nary an actor among them? This predictable joke has an utterly unbelievable series of wonderful action sequences. That is, you can't take your eye off em. But they make this cornball fluff too long and eventually even boring. There is an interminable fight scene during the last 20 minutes that was just pointless.The guys I was with were laughing at the wrong places, the hackneyed plot, set-ups, fights, everything but the car chases.Don't go. Let poor Paul rest in peace."
3,"I am a long time fan of The Fast and the Furious series. Watching it evolve as a franchise over the years has been a great joy and a lot of fun. From the early 2000's feel of the first two to the high octane of the last two, it has been an interesting series to follow. It's great action and fun characters are what has kept audiences coming back again and again. This is why I'm sad to say Furious 7 doesn't deliver in any way. Firstly, the story was a convoluted mess that ultimately made little sense. It's an action movie, I get it, sometimes you've got to turn off your brain. Even if a plot is predictable, it should at least make sense. Furious 7 sees Jason Statham, who was teased at the end of the last film, take on the gang for nearly killing his brother. The trailers advertised the film as Statham vs. the F&F crew, but really it's about them working for the government to get a hacker, to find a program, that they need for reasons, and Djimon Hounsou is an angry warlord. The story never feels like it's sensibly going anywhere, and even if it's all just a setup for action sequences, it barely serves to do that. Nothing is connected and ultimately it's hard to care about what's happening, or for the characters involved.This is where Furious 7 is weakest, it drops everything about the characters that was great. They spew one liners with little passion, Toretto hamfistedly preaches about family to pad length into scenes between set pieces, and everyone else has become a parody of themselves and a stereotype of their race. Jason Statham is completely wasted as his story is sidelined for another. His sole purpose is to show up in every action piece at the worst time to cause trouble for the gang. That's all he does, just show up and kind of make things harder. Along with Statham, Hounsou and Tony Jaa are also wasted in the role of vague villains who don't really seem to have any motives outside of being really evil. Hounsou is an underrated gem, as is Jaa and it was really good to see him in some Hollywood cinema. Too bad neither has much to say nor are they given a shot to deliver anything other than ""bad guy dialogue."" The action is partly the only thing that makes the movie bearable. It keeps things going and at times it is really exciting, particularly thanks to the direction of James Wan. Wan's really only other foray into action cinema was the immensely underrated 2007 film ""Death Sentence."" Unfortunately, all of Wan's creative tricks and ideas can only do so much with what is already a stupid script. Without spoiling too much, the action scenes are a mix of high octane, on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement and physics that push what I previously thought possible to exist within the realm of suspended disbelief. When the characters survive so many impossible feats, it all becomes a wacky show of what will they do next? There is no suspense by the end of the film, you know that despite how ridiculous it is, they'll all be fine. Let's just say the scene in the trailer with the car flying between two buildings in Abu Dabi is a lot more absurd in the actual film, and I lost my self cracking up in the theater. Finally, let's talk about the manipulation of the film. We all know what happened during filming, Rest In Peace Paul Walker. The ending was a nice send off, with Vin Diesel musing about brotherhood. It feels real, all though out of place with the story, but it comes across as genuine. That is until CGI Demon Walker shows up to look into Diesel's soul with glassy eyes that hold the gaze of hell. Seriously, how did they think they could pull that off? The scene on storyboard must have looked really good. Walker pulls up next to Diesel, they share a final moment, and then drive off into the sunset in different directions. They could have achieved this with many other means, considering the real Walker was dead, but no, they had to reanimate him in cold, creepy, uncanny valley digital animation. This final scene could have been a nice send off, but instead it came across as a cheap manipulation to get the audience to feel nostalgic. After an entire ridiculous movie with a ridiculous end to the action, we get treated to a sappy bit shot at what has to be the warmest beach in California. It was sad he passed away so young, he seemed like a decent guy. This ""tribute"" felt more like ""tear bait"" injected in to trick the audience into feeling like they watched a tribute to the career of a great man. Too bad it was just Furious 7. Again, R.I.P. Paul Walker."
3,"First of all I'd like to say this- I respect Paul, I think he was a good actor and had a nice personality. The thing is, I did not see ALL the F&F movies, but this movie was terrible. Of course some will agree and some will not, but except for a few nice landscape shots- I did not like this movie one bit. I did not see anything new, nothing completely different from the other movies that made me say ''wow, this truly is a great movie, unlike anything I've ever seen before''. The fighting scenes were no different than some older and other action movies I've seen, the story wasn't new at all compared to the other F&F movies and other action movies... This movie actually felt like a cliché movie to me. Every single cliché of every action movie- was there. The ending was obvious, the story wasn't a bit new, this movie didn't feel new or worth watching in any way. If you're a F&F movie, you'll probably enjoy this. The reason I gave this movie 3/10 is because of the soundtrack by Wiz Khalifa, the nice landscape shots throughout the movie and the cast (Dwayne, Diesel, Paul and Michelle)."
3,"""Hahahahahaha!"" That's what I kept saying throughout this intellectually insulting and predicable movie. This movie came from the brain child of an 11 year old! Wow! They actually far exceeded my expectations of the ridiculousness I knew would ensue while going into this movie and all the typical phrases and clichés are present. It has the heart of Sharknado injected into the fabric of the F&F universe. I have seen all of the F&F movies. Furious 7, however, took the franchise to whole new level of preposterous.The whole Furious crew is after this guy Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) because he killed the snack eating Japanese guy, Han. But in order to get to him they have to team up with Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) who is after some sci-fi tech called the God's Eye that was created by this hacker, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), whom some private terrorist group have captured. This computer chip has the ability to see every camera, hear every microphone, ATM, computer, in the world to instantly locate anyone on the planet. For some unspoken political reasons all US agencies have been ruled out to find Ramsey and the chip, which is why, of course, they need Dom and his team. If the Furious gang steals the tech then Mr. Nobody will let them use it to find Shaw. Of course the government affords them tricked out cars to go find this special chip. A 4x4 '69 Dodge Charger is the first thing that comes to my mind when I need to chase bad guys. Does Dom always have to drive a '69 Charger? He drives like 4 of them in this movie! One of the many things that do not make sense in this plot is whenever they are after this chip, Shaw conveniently shows up as well, I guess, to get the computer chip too or he is chasing the 7 crew? We never know much about Shaw or where he is throughout the movie; he just magically appears whenever it is convenient for him to be in the plot. This happens more than once. But isn't the reason they are after the chip is in order to get Shaw? So why don't they stop chasing after this chip and everyone direct their energies at Shaw while he is there? No, they want to get away from him first, get the tech they need, to ultimately put themselves back in the same situation they were in when he showed up unexpectedly to then exact revenge. And if he is actually chasing the F&F gang (w/o sounding too logical :/ ) then why not just wait for him to show up instead of risking their lives for some computer chip? The final showdown of this movie is too long to go into here as there would be too much to write. Basically it is one unbelievable piece of action after another. One highlight was when Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is in the hospital and flexes his broken arm in a cast to break it off. WHAT!? Later when he crashes the EMT truck over the bridge at the exact moment the drone is flying under to blow it up was when I seriously lost it and broke out in laughter! There should be a category for movies that are hilarious when they aren't meant to be. And just think, the first movie portrayed everyone (except for Paul Walker's character who was trained F.B.I.) as common street racing thieves in L.A. to this movie where they are now practically trained operative spies taking down mercenaries and chased by missile launching drones. Each subsequent movie becomes more out of touch with reality than the previous. But this one outdid the last and I wonder what was the director James Wan thinking when he approved of all this? What will the next one be named, ""Fast and Furious 8 in Space""? With all of that said, it was still entertaining to watch, like bubble gum for the mind. Even if there is no sensible plot it is still watchable for the laughs almost like Naked Gun (1988) or Airplane (1980). That is kind of sad considering they really can't make a spoof version of this franchise because it is already woven into the films. The characters do not need much development since we know who they are already, which allows for more time to focus on crazy stunts and absurd action. The cars are quite cool, though the focus is no longer on the cars or racing, but more on revenge, espionage, and heist and some short side-show soap opera scenes.The very end was somewhat redeeming to this wacky flick and actually the best part of the whole movie; it kind of got to me. I felt they did an enduring send off for Paul Walker and his character, though it really didn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie. They created a smooth double entendre monologue to say goodbye to Brian the character while actually meaning goodbye, Paul. The top view shot of them in their cars riding side by side to then see them split on different paths was moving and fit perfectly with their friendship, passion for cars, and his exit from the series.However good the end was, 5 minutes does not outweigh 2 hours. You cannot legitimately give this movie a 10 because of that. I think Paul Walker would have been shaking his head left and right and sinking further in seat if he were at the premiere. ""Sorry Paul"" is what the end should have said for making his last movie so bad.3/10. 2 stars for action and entertainment. 1 star for Paul Walker tribute."
3,"I was surprised by the fact this film is so inept , randomly plotted, hastily put together , indifferently acted and clumsily directed (James Wan directed this?). I consider my self a fan of Big budget brainless action pop corn films , however this is nothing but a series of ""money shots"" , (the skyscraper jump, the airplane jump, the bus dangling over the cliff) thinly glued with the flimsiest excuse of a plot about a shadowy bad guy , a lady ""hacker"" (another throw away character), and a government agent. Ultimately we come away none the wiser, save for the knowledge that Dom would rather lay on a beach drinking corona with his buddies and ""family"" (ha! family values!) than fight his evil adversaries and save the civilized world from terrorists. But that's what he does and what he is going to keep doing in the inevitable sequels. And it's a pity to see Kurt Russell in this wreck, but even by Jason Statham standards, this film sets a new low. It all ultimately adds to this: The audience will flock to see on the big screen the over the top Hi-tech Hi-Def Hijinks promised in the preview trailer , no matter if the audience's intelligence will be grossly insulted by the producers of this pile of crap. A worrisome conclusion for the current state of cinematic affairs."
3,"Everything is so predictable in this movie. I was never a big fan of the Fast and Furious franchise but the more sequels they roll out the worse they get. There are scenes where everything falls apart around a character and after 5 minutes of buildings crumbling and debris falling all over, he gets up and has almost no scratch or bruise. If I go for 10 minutes trough a dense forest I get out of there with more cuts and bruises then the guys from this movie.For every fight scene the characters uses brand new cars. It's like they have a warehouse full of cars and they can replace them just as fast as they trash. If I start to think about it, the amount of cars that have been crashed would value more then these guys could earn in a life time.All in all, the action was predictable and kinda unrealistic but the cars are awesome!"
3,"As someone mentioned before, definitely the worst movie in the series. However, three things look promising: direction and two (maybe three or four) actors who know acting (Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham; maybe Michelle Rodriguez for a moment and Kurt Russell). Others are there just to say their lines (Diesel) with absolutely flat facial expression or to smile stupidly (late Walker) and basically just to smash as many expensive cars as possible and destroy basically everything in their way with no consequences. Oh, yes: there are many ""deep philosophical"" thoughts about family, brotherhood and other cheap crap. It's not even fun any more. Reminds me of Mission impossible in a worst possible way. Well, you've probably watched first 6 sequels and you'll go for the seventh (as I did). Go then, but be warned: this movie should have not happened. Poor cars."
3,"Overly dramatic and the scenes were all over the place.I wont say it was the worst film of the franchise because that will forever go to Tokyo Drift (thank god the Tokyo cast was only in the movie for two minutes) but it really was not very good. At a certain point of the movie I was like ""maybe it's not good because Paul died and they had to film"" but no Paul was alive and well during 3/4 of the filming so the movie was just not good, period.However, that ending got me. What a beautiful ending, I got goosebumps when Paul pulled up next to Vin's car and said ""you don't think you were going to leave without saying goodbye"" with a huge grin on his face, just beautiful. It's so sad that we lost Paul and to be honest I thought they were going to kill him off in the film so I was waiting for that but when I realized they didn't I was actually relieved and touched that they chose to give him a beautiful end instead of something that would open wounds that have not fully healed among fans, friends and family.Now my question is, will Mia and the two kids be in the next movie? I doubt it since they have been fazing her out in the past two, with her only having at most fifteen minutes during the film. Han and Gisele are gone as well (sigh so sad, they were my favorites). I hope they don't bring back the Tokyo cast cause they are horrid and well Djimon was plain olé unnecessary to me so the ultimate question is... Where do we go from here?"
3,"this movie is not a good movie and a huge let down and this is why, toretto vs shaw fight is a huge disappointment and a huge let down. shaw couldn't hit anything instead he is getting a huge beating by toretto. the ending of this movie is also disappointing. toretto and his crew ended up fighting jakande who is the secondary villain and not shaw who is the main villain.i hate both vin diesel and james wan. vin diesel is a huge asshole and james wan is a dumbass idiotic director. this movie doesn't make any sense in fact this movie gives me a bad headache. if you think that this 2 hour and 17 minutes action movie is good, than you are wasting your time watching it. it almost gave me a headache to try and make sense of the plot while stifling through countless flaws in the movie. This is a pretty darn bland movie with some poor editing and super cheesy and poorly executed action sequences. Mainly because of the camera execution, it was just lame from start to finish. The acting is pretty bad and seems like regular civilians with shaved heads, some muscle and a beard participated. Or guys that just look slick or a bit geeky played these roles. I like watching movies where it's survival of the fittest, but this movie was boring. I have seen much better from amateur youtube videos and much entertaining as well. Vin Diesel for most the time, looked like he didn't know what he was doing. The movie is about two hours and seventeen minutes and they try to milk every second of it. Because apparently movies have to be at least 2 hour and 17 minutes or close to it. Sure this can play a part in the story, but not when it's constantly shown over and over again. This is a action movie, but just about all of the action in this movie is downright stupid and doesn't make any sense. The story seems like something someone can come up with in like an hour by just sitting and writing. Even the interactions between characters was so bad, cliché and boring. Just pass on this one, it's a waste of time. I give this movie a 3 because they seem to have tried really hard to make a cool, stylish quasi video game style movie."
3,This was supposed to be a franchise where car racing or car chase based action was supposed to take centre stage! Cars parachuting down on to the highway?? Come on!! I would rather see A-Team where they shoot ammo from the tank to guide it mid air. This movie seemed more like a spin off from Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol!! And as the movie progressed it was less about Statham finishing his younger brother's fight and more about generic geeky mumbo jumbo stuff. It would have been awesome if the whole movie was a cat and mouse game between Statham and Diesel. The chemistry between Paul Walker and Diesel was almost non-existent may be be because Paul(may his soul be at peace) passed away before those scenes were shot. And I may be the very few who feel this way but the tribute to Paul Walker was not THAT impressive. Very clichéd. And I am going to watch Eight Below to remember the good sensitive Actor that Paul was. I hope the series ends with this movie. And please let James Bond or Ethan Hunt take over such plots.
3,"Spoilers ahead... Just... REALLY? The action don't make sense, the writing is awful, the acting is a disgrace and well cars jumping through buildings, people surviving a fall of hundreds of meters inside a car that's rolling down a cliff, people getting from one car to another thought the windows while the two cars spin around one another in the middle of a drone persecution, a person that breaks his arm cast only with the pressure that his muscle provides, and why do you take a tech to track people through the internet with you to every single mission, it function through the INTERNET!!. Well I know is an action movie and you can always take a few licenses, but really?"
3,"BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back! But this time they're not pranksters mimicking Pennywise to scare the sh*t out of people for viral memes; they're ""incels"" threatening to gun down everyone who chooses to take their date to this dour, depressing, demented movie.If this Joker were the one featured in Nolan's marvelously entertaining Dark Knight, I doubt any of your skinny lonely drugged-up psychos would be rushing to hail this guy as his hero and inspiration.Ledger's Joker is brilliant, manipulaitve, and consumed with an infectious, and sometimes charming, confidence. Phoenix's Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight. Events spiral out of control in Joker.There is no fun in this movie, no great action set pieces, no hint of hope or optimism. It's a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because ""they've had enough!""Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you'd think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful. Who wants that movie?There are plenty of good character-driven films of mentally disturbed individuals who spiral out of control. There are plenty of good dark gritty super hero movies. This is neither of them."
3,"I was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype.
I actually didn't enjoy watching this movie.
there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying. I don't see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone.
I'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell?"
3,"This was such a disappointment! It was dragging on. And I was waiting for things to explode. I don't get the hype. Everybody is calling this a 'masterpiece', but nobody can tell me why it was such a masterpiece. If it was a movie about how a society creates a killer, then it was done very poorly. To me, it felt just like a large number of scenes without a real story."
3,"Absolute disappointment. I believed the hype like a fool. No person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie, just the stupid reviews. It's so cringe, with nothing actually happening except Phoenix smoking and dancing around. There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted.
I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it.
Best description is millennial joker. Society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention. When none is given, he starts killing."
3,"Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from. It's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this, and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off. It's just a whole lot of self-seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow. It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all, not about the character nor about the society he's part of.It is also 'Joker' only in name and has very little to do with the super-villain. I'm all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit. Even 'Proto-Joker' doesn't quite do it justice, and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e.g. Arthur, The Untalented Mr. Fleck, Smoker, Poser etc. Infact he's more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a clown theme, and is not even close to embodying the joker's extreme form of nihilism. It's not that it has to be a comic-book accurate portrayal, that would be irrelevant if it was genuinely a good movie. But far from being a masterpiece , it doesn't quite manage even that. It fails not just as an inaccurate portrayal of the Joker's spirit or essence, but also as a film about a person going over the edge.The weakest aspect of the movie for me is the poor to average direction. The movie lacks any of the subtlety and nuance that I was hoping for and what unfolds is not as much character development as it is things happening to Arthur. A good example of the poor writing and direction is the very Trump-like and one-dimensional Thomas Wayne character. This first became obvious during a scene in which some people happened to know the entire lyrics to a clown song. In a movie that otherwise tries very hard to be realistic that felt very unnecessary and took me out of the experience and it felt very contrived and predictable after that. It takes too many obvious liberties and plot conveniences to move the story forward in an unnatural and unrefined way, and ultimately felt like they tried to disguise the poor writing and direction with a dark and gritty atmosphere instead of those elements complementing each other.The only reason to watch this movie is Phoenix's performance, which while not groundbreaking is good enough to earn an awards nomination or two. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Heath Ledger's portrayal but they were two very different roles and characters. Ledger made his joker seem effortless while one can really see the strain and work Phoenix puts in. To put it simply, Ledger made it seem natural and didn't look like he was acting while with Phoenix you really know that he is, even to the extent that it may seem like overacting at times. Perhaps owing to the more physical nature of this version of whoever this character is supposed to be, that's not necessarily a criticism.Overall an average film at best that pretends to be a lot more. I don't see this one ageing well or being remembered decades later the way Fight Club or the Scorsese movies it's ""inspired"" by, or CBM's like Dark Knight or Logan or even Tim Burton's Batman, are remembered today."
3,"I do agree that Joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. That however, was the only good part of the film. Movie was dark as I expected, but so much SLOW dialog it was putting me to sleep. Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. I say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, I'd ask for my money back but I did stay till the end."
3,"""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, he's still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... ""it's deep"", ""my feels"", ""It's not a superhero movie it's a character study"", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as.. I'll consider it a generous 3."
3,"Somehow the darkest and most serious movies get the highest ratings. People say that this movie is so thrilling and that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar but at the end of the day, it wasn't entertainment. There were so many evil moments and dark scenes but what's so good about that?This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable. I'll have to watch a movie where the hero is clear and the villain is clear so I can actually be entertained. The fundemental and successful formula for a film."
3,I sat through this slowwwwww movie and would gladly have left half way into it. Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie
3,It's just that boring. really can't understand what the hype is all about??!
3,"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing."
3,This movie is poorly done as to how it tells the story. It is a dark movie showing the problem of mental illness
3,"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society."
3,"I gave 3 stars only because of the spectacular acting, the writing and story get a 0 from me as it doesn't follow any of the hints of joker's origin from other films and shows, so I was displeased to find they made and entire new storyline. I was also annoyed that the Wayne's deaths were included in a new situation as well, almost as if Joker indirectly created batman. Simply I was unhappy with the story they put on the bug screen having been a DC fan my whole life."
3,I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie
3,"After seeing the billboard signs all around the London Underground and learning that the critics has approved of the film in their masses, I was very much looking forward to what appeared to be a very different and almost arthouse interpretation of the Joker.Before I tell you what I think of the film, I want to go into what I believe the Joker to be and the interpretation of him based on the comic books. Firstly as per the source material, the Joker is not actually insane but rather what one psychiatrist in the comics describes as being 'supersane'. He sees the irony in the world and the way that it works. Like the Comedian in the Alan Moore comic book 'The Watchmen' (which at one time was going to use the Joker before settling on the Comedian character), he treats the world as 'one big joke'. The Joker does not like to conform or like to follow rules and regulations. In the comic books the Joker is a failed comedian who is driven over the edge after a series of tragedies and then snaps out at the world. This is by no way saying that his actions are ever justified. On the contrary he is evil, ruthless, daring, sadistic and twisted. But not conforming to societies rules and norms makes him far more intelligent and innovative.With that said, I was somewhat dissapointed in the way that the Joker was portrayed in this new movie. Yes, Joaquin Pheonix is a great actor who deserves recognition for his performance here, though I would stop short to suggest that it is an Oscar worthy performance. But the fact that his character of Arthur Fleck is compromised from the start with both psychological issues and a laughing condition, which makes him laugh uncontrollably when he is nervous or anxious, dumbs down the origins story. One does subsequently feel pity for Arthur throughout the film from seeing him get mobbed by kids on the street, being refused psychological treatment due to funding cuts, being treated terribly by his work colleagues and boss, having to look after his elderly mother, the issue of unrequited love with his neighbour, his subsequent humiliation at the hands of Robert De Niro's character and learning about his mother's past, which leads to the bloody and brutal finale. Ultimately, Arthur's transformation to the Joker is due to the brutality and harshness of society and the way it treats those who are different. Whether this is through its lack of caring for the the sick, the elderly, the mentally challenged or even the physically disabled. The fact that he shows some sympathy to the dwarf character, also strongly suggests that this Joker is not actually evil. This is the complete antithesis of what the Joker is. Infact, I really don't see this interpretation of the Joker successfully standing off against Batman. As a result the film left me somewhat dissapointed. Part of this was also because the script was very poorly written.The redeeming part of the film is the ending, which combined with several earlier flashback scenes makes you wonder whether the events in the film even took place or were just a figment of Arthur's imagination, very similar to the ending of Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America', which suggests that Robert De Niro's character may have dreamed up all the events of the movie. After all the joker does state in the comic book 'The Killing Joke' that if he prefers to have a past, he would rather it be multiple choice, so this is a valid hypothesis. Which leaves us to ponder whether this film should be considered as Cannon to the Batman universe or not. I myself prefer that it was not considered to be cannon and an glad that it is a standalone film.The film is inspired of numerous films throughout the decades, which includes the Kings of Comedy, Clockwork Orange, Taxi Driver, Falling Down, Only God Forgives and Drive. However, I personally don't think it has the intelligence or effectiveness of Falling Down or indeed the panache of another film that I recently saw from Indian cinema, which I would highly recommend to readers, called Wajood starring the brilliant Nana Patekar. For me the Joker could have been a better film as a standalone study of mental illness, without the Batman Franchise being associated with it."
3,"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham."
3,"This movie is a shallow look at mental disorders, and somehow is 2 hours but moves in no direction and drops you back to the beginning. Do not waste your money, go see Hustlers."
3,"Worst movie I've ever seen in my life, the only good part was when Joker shot RobertDinero in the face.
Unless you really really overboard into performing arts (not including acting, because they all sucked)
The only actor that was good in the entire movie was the social worker and the Arkham records administrator😃😄😂🤣🤣 🤡👺"
3,"There is no reason for this movie to have been made. I went because of all the ecstatic reviews. Two hours of relentless blood spilling and gory murders. Giving the Joker this horrific backstory does nothing to enhance the Batman nemesis story. Joaquin Phoenix gives a silly, over-the-top performance. Robert De Nero is the only reason I gave this trash 3 stars. He enhances, but cannot save, this terrible movie."
3,"These reviews claiming this movie to be a ""masterpiece"" etc etc, are absolutely ridiculous. You know the story before you walk in. Much of what happens you predict well in advance. Rather than entertain the audience, it relies on you being fascinated by the antics of a psychotic nutcase whilst trying to convince you that he is somehow heroic."
3,"Cannot understand why this movie gets high score. The content is so bad, gloomy and unreasonable. It is exaggerated too much. How can a mad guy who kill 03 men become a symbol for a mad society??? How can rich men always badly treat or make difficulty to poor guy??? Any reason for a mad crowd tries to protest a senator who is just only standing as a candidate for President position???
Three stars for the good performance of main character."
3,Ive only seen a few batman movies so i decided to go watch joker and since joaquin was the leading actor i thought it would be decent. i was impressed with the movie completely from the narrative to the soundtrack to the ending. and acting from joaquin was phenomenal deserves a OSCAR hands down!!! best performance ive seen in years since decaprio and the revenant. its so good im going next weeknd and watch it again...i havent done that since well ive never done that before. 10/10 movie i couldnt find a flaw in his acting role
3,"Total flat storyline not a single peak moment, nothing new, nothing amazing, nothing entertaining except the acting. Just a man crying about his existence. We have seen this story a thousand times in thousand different movies also multiple times in batman too. We know that joker struggled a lot in his personal life as a common man, dull story ruined the character. I see people saying a lot good about it maybe just because they can't betray their joker but I like joker for his madness not his crying or sick attitude in his personal life."
3,"Despite an extraordinary performance from Phoenix, the film itself is a sub-par experience. It's Taxi Driver lite, from someone who has seen the far superior film and completely failed to grasp its meaning."
3,"If you know bugger all about racing and don't care about an avalanche of Hollywood cliches, I'm sure you will love this. It's beautiful, Bale and Damon are wonderful as always, the sound it wonderful and there are more than one funny scene that made me laugh.However, if you are interested in racing and Le Mans, you will find this toe curling. First of all because of all the cliches are just standing in line for the full length of the movie. Most of all the ever-present protagonist-driver-changes-gear-and-reveals-that-he-hadn't-floored-the-accelerator-until-now stupidity. In fact they repeat this once every five minutes. And of course the drivers' ability to look over at other drivers for seconds at a time while they sit in a race car that does 974 km/h! Oh and of course the Hollywood cliche that never fails: Le Mans drivers that drive like it's stock car racing. Slamming into each other, going off the road intentionally, spinning and crashing out in epic fireballs ... they are all there in their vomit inducing glory. There's the totally unrealistic racing environment, handling of the race cars, driver and pit crew behaviour, a totally unbelievable person gallery and a farcical historical depiction. And of course there is the oh-so-evil suit and tie wearing villains and the oh-so-good heroes, which we are supposed to believe actually existed.Sigh! I felt absolutely nothing for any of the people at the end. Neither for the good guys nor the bad. If you are a racing fan, don't go watch this garbage."
3,"Matt Damon and Christian Bale both gave terrific performances, but I felt like the movie was lacking something throughout. In a movie about trying to build the world's fastest car they never show anyone actually build a car. It sets up a problem and then cuts immediately to the solution. I also feel like the ending is 20 minutes too long."
3,"Okay, where do I begin ? I personally think the movie is bad, I mean really bad. That was torture."
3,"It's not easy to make car racing look interesting on film, as shots of cars going around corners and faceless drivers shifting gears start to feel pretty repetitive. Though the many scenes of fast driving do add some adrenaline, the film has to rely on a dramatic arc that hinges on the possibility of building a fast car and getting the right driver. Unfortunately this dilemma advances all too predictably, and features static characters in cookie-cutter relationships that feature no real tension and no development whatsoever. The characters are drawn well enough to elicit a few laughs at unexpected juxtapositions, but mostly they just go through the motions, and we literally hear the same overblown lines at the end of the film as we do at the beginning, as though the film wanted to remind viewers that nothing actually happens in between. Some nice period touches and decent turns by some supporting actors working with limited material demonstrate that the filmmakers were at least trying, but the flat relationships and tepid dialog keep things moving at a snooze. Maybe watch it on an airplane if there's nothing better?"
3,"I've never taken Christian Bale for a great actor. His appeal is for people who enjoy some kind of technical perfection and fake authenticity over substance. His performance should keep rubes occupied, thinking they have witnessed something genuine, an example of what acting is supposed to be.Moving on to the story. Naturally, much of this didn't happen. The pitting of big corporatist Ford Motors against Miles the humble car racer was all made up and I guessed it while watching the film - they just put these cliches in knowing that millions of not so bright members of the public will never get tired how many thousands of times they have experienced these tropes. Anything to get people punching their fists in the air and rooting for their hero. Read the facts of the Miles story if you care at all.The only real recommendable parts of the film and the reason I bothered seeing it, were the racing scenes which are thrilling. The rest, acting, plot are still somewhere on the starting line."
3,"I give this film three stars only because it wasn't my type of movie - I am certain folks who are into racing and action films will truly enjoy it. I saw it because it got nominated for multiple Oscars, and because a friend of mine assured me I would like it. Unfortunately, the combination of my lack of interest in the subject matter coupled with the rah-rah Go America message (at the expense of the Italians, naturally) was a bit too much. I do love Christian Bale and Matt Damon as actors, and the technological prowess on display was impressive (sound, editing, CGI, etc.), so I am still glad I saw it. I also appreciated the fact that it was based on a true story and that the Ford Motor Company and the characters involved came across realistically as the less-than-admirable individuals they were."
3,"I kind of, sort of, walked out of this movie. Not because it was terrible or anything but I just didn't care about the characters. The movie also wasn't very ""cinematic"" although I'm not entirely sure what I mean by that. Now, I am not interested in racing but if you compare this movie to Rush, a movie I waited to see because I wasn't interested in the subject matter, it's night and day. I really enjoyed Rush. It exceeded my expectations by far. This movie was not very good.The thing that bothered me most was Bale's performance and it might be the worst I've ever seen him do, although that's a pretty high bar. He plays a caricature of someone, not an actual character. And he ruins it for me because the whole family dynamic is awkward. There's 0 chemistry and it doesn't seem real in the least. I couldn't take him or the movie seriously. The scene when his wife is swerving all over the road and yelling at him was weird and out of nowhere. The son barely says a word.The movie is way too long. Every scene seemed to be the same after two hours. Let's have more shots of Matt Damon's character standing in front of the sun. Let's start every scene out with some classic guitar playing for nostalgia's sake to get you excited. The only good scene was when Bale's character talks about the perfect lap, that's it."
3,"Disappointed ! Matt Damon might be a good actor but the script he was given is a dud. Childish arguments repeating throughout remind me of the 1968 Elvis movie Speedway more than a story depicting greats like Carol Shelby and Henry Ford 2. Having said that is is structured so that once you are sitting there watching you want to see the outcome, even though you know how it ends. There must have been 20 minutes wasted looking at the side of Christian Bales head while driving, with a competitor in the background moving back and forward in an unrealistic manner. The Butterworth boys would have done well to actually go to a race track and watch at least one car race. How many minutes watching a foot on a brake pedal and accelarator do we need to waste ? Surprisingly one of my friends has been to this movie 4 times, but he is a car guy, not a movie buff. It will appeal to Donald Trump voters I suspect."
3,"I don't recommend it. The drama was all about unconvincing excuses for depicting violence. Dramatic scenes and loud sounds does not in itself constitute good cinema. I had the thought that watching the move was like watching paint dry, but loudly.Techincally it was well done but there is no real story there, just famous names (both the actors and the characters depicted)."
3,"This movie might have been better titled ""The Ken Miles Bio"" for the almost complete absence of point to point competition between the two car marques. Hollywood has yet to make an excellent racing movie but this one isn't even in the top ten. I gave it a three for excellence in period features such as technology, classic cars and the like. The secondary actors were better than the primaries. Don't waste your money."
4,"While the ending to Furious 7 was executed extremely well, the same cannot be said for the rest of the movie. The acting fell flat and it was nothing more than a two and a half hour long soap opera that has started since the franchise stopped racing cars. The loves scenes became ridiculous and the car action increased in more B.S. than Congress. The movie recycled every cliché in the book. The fighting actions that involved Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) was welcoming. Jason was Deckard during those moments and he played the part well. All the random moments where he would show meant you knew it was about to go down. When he appears, action is none stop between Domini Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Deckard Shaw, with the fighting between the two intensify with every encounter.Furious 7 has an incredible tribute to a man that was loved by many and he deserved nothing less. But that alone cannot make this movie be worthy of anything higher than a 7."
4,"I never got vested into the series until #5, still my favorite installment because they were finally honest and embraced the fact these are live-action cartoons and with each of the many ""Yeah, right!"" near misses and stunts, it makes it actually fun. #6, though not as good, but still entertaining, carried that tradition.Unfortunately, someone decided to go back to being serious. Sure, there were some ""Yeah, right!"" scenes I enjoyed in Furious Seven, but they were few and far between. In fact, maybe just 2-3 in an almost 2½ hour movie. Sad.Not to say this was a bad movie. The action scenes, though cut down tremendously from previous chapters, were really good. Mostly involving Paul Walker. And speaking of PaulYes, RIP Paul. I really did like him and his presence in movies. But, his part here seemed almost irrelevant. Yup, I liked his fighting the same dude twice, and he did have the most exciting ""Yeah, right!"" escape in the best chase/action scene in the film. But, his part in the team just seemed blah. I understand his arc, destination, etc, but his character was actually the lamest of all of themincluding the bad jokester.What I did like most about Furious Seven were the characters played by Michelle Rodriguez and Kurt Russell. They absolutely kept things interesting. Unfortunately, the two I wanted to like more, but was sadly let down by, were: one of my favorite action stars, Jason Statham who was not as exciting to watch as is the case in any of his other films and The Rock, whose measly 10 minutes of screen time was a joke.Unbelievably, for this series, that is, they worked on the story and, while still simple, it was enjoyable. Basically it was twofold – revenge from the brother of someone they previously killed (Die Hard with a Vengeance, anyone?) and yet another big brother device they need to obtain from the bad guys sothe US government can use it. Um, seriously? I am proud to be an American, but would absolutely think that device would be best in the bad guy's hands than in our Government's. (Thoughthey probably already have something similar, if not exactly the same, to the one in the movie, anyways.)While the movie was decent and the few action scenes were good, I'm not 100% leaning on a recommendation since it was just sodamnlong. And what we came for just took too much time to get to. Maybe for fans, but even then, they were probably expecting what I was: another silly live- action cartoon, albeit fun, ride. They just took it way too seriously, especially for a part 7 in a franchise. That all said, at least director James Wan gave the dudes in the audience the two things they wanted most. And when those two things showed up, for my own amusement, I had to shout out at the screen: ""GIRLS! GIRLS!"" and ""RACE SCENE!"" (Taken from a hilarious YouTube video that summarized the previous six installments. And don't worry – the movie was so flipping loud, especially during those scenes, no one could hear me.)* * *Final thoughts: Yes, this is a movie. Yes, fiction. But, dang it, one of the most pointless and clichéd scenes that simply drove me nuts was one where a gun could've ended a dispute, but was discarded in lieu of a street fight. Again, I recognize this as a fictional movie, and definitively a Fast & Furious sequel, and Indiana Jones already did what I wantedbut still, it was frustrating. At least make the person run out of bullets and then do the butch, male fighting. Sheesh!"
4,"You definitely should go watch this movie in the cinema!!!I can safely say that this was the funniest movie that I have watched in a past couple of years. And when I am talking about humor, I do not mean all the lame cliché ""so called jokes"" by Luda and Tyrese; it is the overall movie that made all the audience cinema laugh for two hours. The reason why Bollywood has crazy action scenes is because they can not afford CGI and other equipment; however, this movie is a whole new level. Part 6 had some really crazy things happening with flying cars and 100 km runways... I have no idea what the writers and the director were smoking when they created this.... Don't get me wrong, the action scenes were intense and extremely captivating; it is just they were even more ludicrous than Fast 6. In this movie every character had some type of superpower; it felt like watching X men racing in fast explosive cars.The only reason why this movie is not a 1 is because Jason Statham is an ultimate bad-ass who played his part very well.Get ready to burst from laughing, because no matter what I type here, it will not prepare you for what you are about to witness."
4,"This movie was over-hyped with the pre-release death of Paul Walker and that's it. It is long and that should be warning enough if you plan to watch this in a theater and not end up enjoying it. Jason Statham just drops in as big brother out for revenge and in my opinion a big let down for big fans of his like me. He just pops up in every single plan devised by Vin Diesel's crew which is actually a bit too much. There could have been a bit of character building for him but unfortunately it ain't there. No story here but then that would be expected of such a movie. If they plan to kill the franchise with this one, I think they have succeeded. The ""family sticks together"" and "" all I have got is family"" dialogs are re-used and someone in the dialog dept needs to come up with some fresh ones. Action scenes do not look realistic and they are over blown to the limits.If you are going to watch it for the cars, even that is a big let down. Save your money and watch it on DVD or cable cos that's all this movie is worth. And I believe Universal should stop with this sequel completely. 4 stars just for the action scenes which you could watch in the trailer itself ..!!!"
4,"I want to make it clear, first and foremost, anyone dying is a tragic thing, Paul Walker was far too young and his career was only just beginning. I don't want my opinion of this film to be considered disrespectful.Furious 7 is so, so far from what the franchise used to be that I found myself ceasing to care. When did this series forget it is about cars?Set after the events of Fast and Furious 6, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his friends, excuse me ""family"", become targets for Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is out for revenge after they killed his brother. Toretto's team is recruited by a shadowy covert operation to hunt Shaw down, but to do so they need a device called The God Eye, a computer hacking tool that can simultaneously access all of the cameras in the world.This film has excessive action sequences, often running for twenty minutes or more at a time, explosions, attack helicopters, predator drones, hundreds of half naked women everywhere, flashy cars for no reason at all, bad jokes, product placement, over-long running time and most of all lazy writing. Sounds familiar right? Yet unlike many Michael Bay films this gets a free pass from critics?? This is appalling.At first I had high hopes; the opening features Dom attempting to remind his Amnesia-saddled girlfriend Letty of her past by taking her to Race Wars (a key moment in the first film) as well as his visit to Tokyo and speaking to the forgotten lead actor Lucas Black from the third film Tokyo Drift. An early bout between Statham and Dwayne Johnson's returning Agent Hobbs was also excellent.But it lost me after the sky-diving cars (yes, sky-diving cars, if you haven't seen the trailer) when our heroes, for the most redundant reason ever, must go to Abu Dhabi. After a manic mountainside battle they somehow go to Dubai in the flashiest super cars which even Toretto wouldn't drive. A Bugatti Veyron, seriously? Where did they get one of those? From the local Dubai Veyron rental service?? Going to Dubai is because a chip required for the God Eye device had been installed in a super car literally no reason why. This makes the sixth movies' idea of putting a valuable microchip inside a tank inside an armoured motorcade seem believable!But why all of this nonsense? Why do we need a God Eye device? Because Jason Statham's character is so skilled that he can virtually teleport around the world completely untraceable. Or as I like to call it: lazy writing.The film is a constant, constant battlefield after the first twenty minutes. Not only do we have Statham appearing randomly throughout, but we also have Djimon Hounsou as a a bad man? The character development is astounding. We have his stock Asian martial artist, as well as a random burly woman in a dress for Michelle Rodriguez to fight once.This film is just immature nonsense; a weird mash of Mission Impossible, Michael Bay films and The Expendables.The action sequences when appreciated in isolation are impressive, that scene in Abu Dhabi is awesome and certainly something I've never seen before But I need story substance and narrative cohesion to care; the Fast films used to have some semblance of structure to them, now its just a barrage of noise."
4,"Fast & Furious 7 feels like an episode of a soap opera that has been on air way too long. Almost all of the fun and excitement that Justin Lin somehow managed to bring to the series with 5 and 6 is gone and instead we get a messy series of very confusing and nauseating action scenes that are so over the top that they wouldn't feel out of place in a comic book movie. Some will like that, I get it. But I miss the times when every movie did not end in a bloated CGI-set piece that goes on for 30 minutes and everything is destroyed. Also the word ""nauseating"" is very important. During most of the action scenes I had no idea what was happening on screen thanks to the shaking and the editing. James Wan also likes to do this thing where he tilts the camera which I'll admit sometimes looks good (I liked this in The Conjuring) but it DOES NOT work here. I sat pretty front in the theater and whenever the camera tilted like that I felt nauseous. That is not a problem everybody will have but I'd say don't sit very front in the theater. The storyline is extremely confusing and FF7 feels like two movies edited into one. I'm sorta willing to forgive them for it for two reasons. 1) It's clearly because Paul Walker died. 2) It's a Fast & Furious movie. What I won't give a pass on is bad action and Furious 7 is filled with that. Isn't that the big thing about action movies? They should have good action scenes. I also think that the change from Lin to James Wan was a bad call. FF7 looks and sounds like a Fast & Furious movie but Wan just doesn't nail the tone. There are couple exciting parts. Whenever The Rock shows up the movie is suddenly good. It's too bad he's in it for like 10 minutes. Tony Jaa also makes a brief appearance. He sure can fight, too bad whoever was filming and editing those fights did a terrible job. Now I saved the best for last. KURT RUSSELL is in Furious 7. Kurt Russell. Perhaps my favorite actors of all time. He has a very brief role but he looks like he's having lots of fun. He could have totally phoned in that performance, it's a really small role but like The Rock whenever Kurt Russell gets to be Kurt Russell he just lights up the screen. He has one scene that is actually so badass that I actually got chills. Too bad it's like 5 seconds long. So how to fix Fast & Furious 8? Strip it down a lot. No need for all that excessive action. If it were up to me, I would just do a buddy cop movie with Kurt Russell and The Rock."
4,"Furious 7 is everything that you expect from this franchise - Cars, explosions, babes & logic-defying action sequences. Fast & Furious 6 set the bar for stupidity quite high with its infinite runway sequence, and thankfully, Furious 7 does NOT top that. The story is simple and linear. The crew members are happy and settled in their lives, when they are (obviously) pulled back into the world of cars and crime. It takes them 7 movies to travel to the world hub of luxury cars. Here any person who has, at any point of time in his life, had even the tiniest crush on an automobile, is bound to have an orgasm. A couple of bootys here, a couple of cars flying there and our minds are satiated with this part of the movie. After that we don't mind the dandiya sequence between Diesel and Statham. The performances are good, although Dwayne could have been given a little more screen time, and Jason could have been given a little more dialogue so that he wouldn't have looked like a glorified hit-man. The music is like the display of Nathalie Emmanuel's assets - it had potential, but it wasn't used. All in all, an expected addition to the franchise. The tribute to Paul Walker in the end, is what makes it special."
4,"Essentially dire. Terrible script, no story line, and laughable action scenes, e.g. police stations built completely out of brittle glass, or massive street destroying explosions from small packages. Hopeless. My wife and I were so gripped by this film that I'm on the computer writing this review and she is using her smartphone.You can cant live this time again, don't waste it watching this."
4,"I liked part 5 and 6 from the series. Sure I liked part 1 and 2 because I was young at that time and I liked the car tuning and racing. But then I grew up and it kinda lost my interest. Then they did Tokyo drift: different scene, different actors, and later on I started to appreciate the series when we arrived at part 5 and 6. They were funny, full of action and not dead-serious, and they were good guys doing not-so-good things (stealing the forbidden fruits so to speak). In other words a nice escape from realism and just be a block of testosterone for 1.5 to 2 hours. The characters in these movies did what they loved and did it for who they loved.Part 7 really annoyed me. I'm not gonna give the movie 1 stars, because people still did put in a lot of hard work and the ending of the movie was beautiful. But I also mean that literally: the ending was the best part of the movie, because that meant the movie was finally over. But also because Vin Diesel actually came on screen as being a human being instead of being a one-liner robot trying to look tough and wise non-stop. If your character on-screen isn't impressed by anything anymore, or touched by anything, it's pretty hard to be touched as a viewer as well by that same character.The movie was full of hard action (no soft, sweet explosions but rough and raw ones, like the sound of metal clinging), and things like sympathy and humor seem to be missing totally. It felt as if the characters had to do this mission, without really wanting it or put their heart into it. I experienced it as a superficial one-liner movie in which no real character development took place. They wanted to portrait Paul as a family man, but how I experienced this was as if they put in the script: ""Paul playing with family, make 3 turns swinging kid in the air, smile for 5 seconds, move on to the next one-liner from Vin Diesel, move on to the next action-scene"".Of course I know these movies aren't known for their realism or in- depth characters, but at least their characters were somewhat real/authentic/understandable previously. But even the joke-man in this movie looks so serious all the time as if he needs to take a dump during the entire movie. I'm not even gonna discuss his awkward party-scene in Abu Dhabi. The role of Kurt Russell is also fitting for the name his character gives himself in the movie: Mr. Nobody. He acts super-superficial, as if this movie was a nice little extra (financially) for Russell, but there's no character growth or identification when compared to Hobbs in the previous parts for example. The only character growth you'll see is that when Mr. Nobody is shot and seriously injured, he promises Vin Diesel he will switch from Belgian beer to Corona's. Seriously. I feel they had a script and just had to include things like Mr. Nobody and ""God's Eye"" just to fill up some gaps.And let's not forget Hobbs who in this movie is completely unbelievable (in a bad way). He rips his plaster by flexing his muscles, he sees a building explode nearby and doesn't even wink, he just goes full Clint Eastwood-mode and says: ""Toretto"". His little girl is in the hospital-chamber when all of this happens and he just walks up and says: daddy's gotta go to work. Again it feels very forced, as if he said: You are not really my kid, but the script said we needed Hobbs to have a kid (for making him human or something?) for 10 seconds, so we put you in this room. Now beat it, because I'm gonna steal an ambulance and with it bring down a drone, then take a mini-gun, then shoot at a helicopter, and finish the job like a wild wild west revolver gunslinger. I mean when someone would actually say stuff like that it would be funny, but somehow it didn't connect with me when i was watching it.So, in my opinion: this movie is trying to be funny when it shouldn't be, overacting-tough when it should be human, and way too serious when it could be funny. Feels like it's trying too hard and therefore misses its mark. Great ending though."
4,"I've been involved into Fast and Furious family for the last 14 years or so, and I hoped that they will end series of one of the biggest movies with a BANG, but man I was wrong.I started watching F&F movies because of cars, the action, and the thrill they bring with themselves. Along the way I felt in love with the actors, and I (as weird as it sounds) was looking at the actors in the movie as ""mi Familia"". I went onto premiere last night thrilled and excited because I finally had the chance for the closure with F&F. I hoped that they will have in the final movie more cars, races, tuning etc. At last, that was the reason this movie was success after all. MAAAN, I WAS WRONG. I left the cinema with bitter taste in my mouth. Disappointment, anger, sadness. Mixture of emotions, all negative ones. The only part of the movie I enjoyed besides 'beginning' and huge The Rock vs. Statham fight was the part where they retrospectively showed inserts from the first few sequels. The rest of the movie was mixture of Star Trek and some Van Damme movie. I can't say I just didn't like it. I kind of hated it. They went totally the opposite way than they primarily wanted to go in the beginning of the franchise. I can say that my brother who is a huge fan as well felt asleep multiple times in the mid-point of the movie. At least they had some reality and probable scenes in the previous sequels. It is absolutely impossible to do 99% of things they've done in this one. It was utterly gross, too much sci-fi, and too little of cars to be considered as F&F family member. Not even The Rock, Paul Walker or Vin Diesel could pull this one out of misery. To sum up, save your money and time. IF YOU'RE BIG FAN LIKE MYSELF OF FAST AND FURIOUS, I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH IT. YOU WILL LEAVE THE CINEMA DISAPPOINTED.4/10 in best. And that is because of special effects, otherwise it would be 3/10."
4,"With a pardon in hand, the Fast & Furious team tries to settle down to normalcy. A relative of an old foe, Shaw, however, starts hunting the members down. This especially disrupts the life of Brian O'Connor, who is having trouble readjusting to a non FBI, non fugitive lifestyle of being a house dad.I saw this film two weeks ago, and I still can't get it out of my head. It is not that shocking of a story, but it was that eerie. Unfortunately, that eeriness wasn't achieved by film art. It all had to do with Paul Walker's death. (Nothing like realism to wreck an escapist yarn) Unlike Brian O'Connor, the character that Paul Walker had created some fifteen years ago, the actor wasn't able to walk away from a fiery car crash. Which is troubling because three of the four signature stunt scenes in this film involved O'Connor walking away from car wrecks. And the fourth...First of all, some credit...Some of the stunts worked. Andy and Jack Gill, the stunt coordinators, gave most of the stunts a seamless look.James Wan's direction was just okay. His jump cuts weren't needed. And while some of the stunts scored, a lot were underwhelming or silly concepts. Flying cars?!?? And it's curious as to why he avoided showing the race between Dominick Toretto and Sean Boswell. (That race has been expected for the past four films. Not showing it was bad form.) Give Wan kudos for pulling the best performance out of Kurt Russell (as nameless) in several years. Also give him a gold star for getting a good performance out of Jason Statham, as the villain, Deckard Shaw. For the first time ever, Statham's acting wasn't a distraction.It was also unnerving how Wan and the studio handled Paul Walker's final scenes. To complete this film the studio used digital technology to create images of Brian O'Connor in some sequences, including his last scene with Vin Diesel. It looked phony.I've seen all the Fast & Furious films. I liked the first one the least; the fifth one, Fast Five, the most. Of them, I had only seen the fifth installment twice. It was always a good sell to me, for I pegged it for what it was: a popcorn film series...like flash Gordon, or Jason and the Argonauts. If you like looking at fast cars, and Evil Kneivel stunts, then these first few stories were for you. None of these stories reflected what went into street racing philosophies or realities, though. Not once in any of the Fast films did I ever see a driver lose control and fly through a house or a storefront. There were no overturned light poles or traffic signals. And no one was sent to the hospital after getting rammed by an out of control racing car. The closest the filmmakers came to collateral damage in the series was when a safe took out a bank.Reality was never a high point with these films. What made the Fast & Furious franchise succeed was their reliance upon stunts first...so it was especially out of character to see flying cars. Rob a bank, heist a Hollywood truck, smuggle some illegals, and get some free gas were major plots of four of these first five films. They kept to blue collar interests. The sixth installment had the most unbelievable – way unbelievable – plot. And in Furious 7??? The plot line gets even more bizarre. Find ""God's Eye?"" Is this the sign of a tired series?Having trouble separating the Paul Walker tragedy from the film? It's an easy reaction to spot. If you are interested in seeing Furious 7 out of curiosity on how they will resolve the Brian O'Connor dilemma, then there is CONFLICT. As I pointed out, this film series has avoided realistic situations its entire run, and the sixth installment ran as fast as they could in the other direction. Thinking that number seven recasts the mold is wishful thinking.Me? I was conflicted at first. I rewatched the film hoping...maybe...these wacky stunts SAVE the film. But each time I see them now, the image of Walker's car ablaze keeps flashing back in my head. And I think: ""What a waste...""Addendum: Vin Diesel just announced that there will be a Fast & Furious 8. This comes after his pronouncements before the film was released in mid April 2015 that if there was an eighth installment, he would not be involved. Of course that was more than a billion dollars ago.Whichever...this is the last one for me. As these story lines become more incredulous, it's well past the point of being a popcorn movie. It is now getting into the territory of being a joke."
4,"I managed to skip all the movies after the first one but got tricked by some positive reviews into wasting my time watching this. As each scene passed I felt a little bit of my intelligence and soul leech out into the ether. The dumbness was overpowering. From the comedy level pumped up arms and chest of the actors, to the stupid earnestness they pursued their vacuous lives,everything about this movie is dumb, big, and dumb. I had to skip over parts of it just to survive it's all pervasive stupidity. I've seen Dwyane be good in other films, but not here, Even Vin's done decent work that doesn't aim for the brain dead grunters, but there's no sign of that here, there's no indication of self-awareness. I should have stuck with my instincts and avoided this. What was I thinking? What were they thinking."
4,"Yesterday, I went to the cinema for watch this film because has 8'1/10 of average, more much note than the others prequels and was a best film in the Box Office with more of 100.000.000 $ . The question is not what is possibly the best Fast & Furious, is THE BEST.Leaving for the end to Paul, the film has other innovations, compared with the prequels of Lin. I would say the best is the addition of Jason Statham/Deckard Shawn as enemy. And the incorporation of Kurt Russell.I think that Furious 7 is a one of the best movie action of this year. The scenes are brutal, if you liked the movies of Lin, this if you like more. Pure persecution burning wheel, explosions, more explosions, buildings breaks with a car of million of dollars... and jump of a plane! And the tribute to Paul, is very emotive. RIP, Paul. This movie deserve this 8'1. I was applauded at the cinema..."
4,"Seriously. As a friend of me described. This is a film for horny teenagers right? In the entire film. There was only one good scene. And that was the tribute scene for Paul Walker (Otherwise it would have been a 4). That, to be honest. Made me a bit emotional. Especially the scenes from the first two movies (Which I did enjoy very much). Al the rest? Just a lame ass Hollywood milking cow. Bad Story, and Sorry, even the action was predictable, not believable and stupid.After the first two movies it only went downhill. Every sequel in this franchise gets worse and worse. Absolute waste of time.And what about the cast? I had my hopes up for Jason Statham. Not a state of the art actor. But knows how to deliver some good ass action. His role in this movie was unfortunately too small, but still pretty bed in comparison to a film such as Crank."
4,"I'm not enjoy this movie because i know about cars, how the internet work or can differentiate between real and cartoon violence..All cast in this movie act like they can't kill by everything.. Maybe this movie is similar like Die Hard or The Expandable.. Just my opinion..This movie only show about priceless car, money, women, muscle, handsome guy, and something like that..I don't understand why this movie could have a good rate..I give 4 star because they've good work for organize this movie until the end without Paul Walker.."
4,"I'm going to start by saying that I do not like these kinds of movies, and they hold no attraction for me anymore. Stories based on revenge and action, and men being all masculine showing off their muscles and justifying killings and destruction. Not to mention the objectifying of the female body. Is it really necessary to have women extras walking around almost naked and having close-ups of their asses? NO. I really cannot stress this enough, and how I really cannot stand movies that do this.The story seems really identical to the other films. Though I did not watch all the movies I do remember watching the 6th one and the 3rd one, and this series is just so formulaic. Bad guys, crew members who are like family taking the bad guys down, authorities stepping in, destruction, guns and fast cars. There isn't really anything new with the films and I really wonder what makes it so popular.That's about all I've got to say. Nice cars, cool races and action with some verging on impossible. I'm getting tired of watching films based on action and masculinity. For heaven's sake The Rock tensed his muscles and his cast came off! A super cheesy and super wtf moment.Also, I was wondering how they ended up fixing Paul Walker's parts, and it actually isn't very noticeable. I think his nose looks a teensy bit sharper towards the end, because they were using CGI effects in addition to the help of Walker's brothers but it could still go unnoticeable. There are quite a few scenes in the film in which had me thinking they had an editing problem though. Some lines would be repeated and some of the same shots played over again in the same sequence. I don't know what happened there.I know many might not agree with me, but I write how I feel and you don't have to agree. We all have different opinions.

4,"""It is soooo good! Oh my god you will cry at the end! Such a good film, Paul Walker was amazing!"" ...are all I seem to be hearing about this film, which I reluctantly went to see. Meh, I thought, a it'll be some mindless violence and if people are raving about it, perhaps it will be better than I expect......It wasn't. Fans of the films are going to love it either way. Everyone else will be divided by either how gullible they are, how much they enjoy mindless action, and how humorous they find things.Don't me wrong, I absolutely love mindless action movies, But the thing for me with this movie, is that it's not actually clear if they are taking the film seriously. I know, obviously it's not meant to be realistic, but if they aren't taking it too seriously then they do a bad job of showing it.Usually in decent action films, the characters sometimes reference how out of control a situation is. Even if it's just a ""woah that's crazy"" or Take Bad Boy's II for example. They had cars thrown at them during the chase scene, but it was OK because the characters acknowledged that it was not a normal thing to be happening ""They're throwing cars at us Marcus, how am I not seeing that!?"" With Furious 7, not a single character seemed to realise what they were doing was complete and utter bonkers. (It still baffles me how they can drive a car through three skyscrapers and everyone just acts as if it's no biggie).And oh the cheese! In the end I spent more time laughing out loud at the films ridiculousness, than actually really even enjoying it. This film oozes with cheesy dialogue, cheesy clichés and cheesy performances. The nail in the ol coffin even came pretty early on when they jumped the shark with Statham and Diesel crashing their cars head on to each other and getting out with a scratch. From there, I couldn't take anything they did at all seriously. Everything was laughable, even the obviously supposed 'dramatic' parts such as the aftermath of Vin Diesel pulling a 'Die Hard' and trying to take down a helicopter with a car.At least JohnMcClain had the sensibility to get out of the car first.Plot wise, trying to make it anything more than a revenge film, just made it a mess. In some parts, it even felt like watching cut scenes from a game.Annnnd now onto the Paul Walker send off. Personally I thought it was OK, kinda cheesy, and didn't stir up any emotions. (For me his best role was in Running Scared, so his character in this was 'meh' to me.)They did do well making a film with one of the main cast passing during shooting, however it was just not a good film. And I refuse to give it praise just because it was Paul Walkers last film. A bad film is a bad film.In the end I give it a 4, but more like a 5 just sheerly because I really did enjoy laughing at it."
4,"It's really getting old when the bad guy is somehow one step ahead or right behind. In this case, Shaw somehow finds the team around the world more than once, and is in contact with other scumbags. He has unlimited funds, weapons, vehicles, intel, and balls. It's a good thing people like this only exist on screen.The American black ops team is shown as the sloppiest and most unprepared team on Earth.Of course, it's the seventh installment of this goofy franchise and it's more like a dream than a movie.Have a few drinks, and you will enjoy it."
4,"Finally got around to see this one and man, what a drag. This movie is so silly its not even funny, sure there are some scenes that are exciting, lots of ass and 'splosions, but you really have to switch off your brain. Plus there is definitely too little Rock in it. The Rock was the one that made F&F reasonably fun in the last 2 movies, they literally striped him to a bed for the whole film, what a waist.The whole memory loss thing was a bit odd to me, it kinda didn't make any sense and was pretty pointless to the movie. Then you have the crew go around the world to find a gizmo to find the Shaw, Shaw shows up but you still worried about the gizmo. The whole plot made absolutely no sense, it was distracting when Shaw appeared 3 freaking times in the location where you are trying to grab a thingymagic to find Shaw. WTF?? Not going to mention the silly action, I agree that if these were set up as superheroes I would mind less, but not a big deal. Nice touch at the end with homage to Walker. But yeah, F&F7 is on par with Transformers 4."
4,"Yes, I know this film is designed to be merely some fun (mindless) action/ entertainment (well, I sure hope that was the intention), but it falls short of even that.I can understand the need for suspension of disbelief when viewing this type of film, but these plot contrivances were beyond incredulous. (Spoiler) The God's-Eye story arc was unreasonably far-fetched to begin with, but the further sub-plot about it being sold to an Arabian Billionaire was completely inane.The film's main appeal, the action, was not enough to redeem it in the slightest. Too over the top and CGI dependent, it just came across as silly and completely unbelievable (and I'm not meaning, 'suspension of disbelief' unbelievable, I'm talking just plain stupid)The obligatory 'good guys almost lose, but win in the end' plot points were painful to watch, and did not manage to create a sense of suspense in the slightest. The 'romance' between Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez was excruciating to experience, as was much of the cliché dialogue. The only tolerable performances came from Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson (with Gibson managing to offer *some* comedic relief). It is difficult to decide who gave the poorest performance; Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson (the latter, I am fairly certain pronounced 'cavalry' as 'calvary', a word with a completely different meaning). Kurt Russell's appearance was downright sad. The one-liners seemed almost like satire. The montage of Paul Walker at the end was endearing, but it is ultimately sad that he was associated with such a poor film. There did seem to be some real emotion from the other cast members in the final scene, but it was unfortunately overshadowed by the long, excruciating, ridiculous film that preceded it.As of the 7th of April, this title is rated 8.2 on IMDb. I cannot understand how anyone can honestly claim that this is a good film."
4,"This series has been showing numerous numbers of unrealistic stuffs. And I've been quite enjoying them honestly. But this seventh film has just broken the limit. Now it's just ridiculous. They used to show few innovations in the previous films. But this time they've probably figured, ""Hey, we've gotten the fans hooked. We've brought in a new star, and a core star died. So there's no way this one need anything new. We'll just repeat 50% stuffs from the previous movies, steal another 20% from other franchises and add a lot of clichés to fill in the rest.""I didn't expect the cast to do any legendary acting, but the least they could do is actually be in ""character"" during the filming. All of the actors were like just ""being themselves"".And about the stunts and CGIs, be as ridiculous as you want just represent is somewhat believable. The subplots are probably some of the worsts. ""God's Eye"", seriously? Seriously they expect to sell this crappy idea??The only reason this film is this much successful is because of the death of Paul Walker. There I've said it."
4,"I don't even know where to start but this film was perhaps the most mind numbing action film I've seen for a long time. Definitely not worth going to theaters. That's it in a nutshell.Fast and Furious has come a long way from the first movie to its seventh installment. Franchise is very popular and hence the high amount of sequels. I genuinely liked the first one and few sequels were okay too. But now, director James Wan tries to poke the series with his ""vision"" that seems more like a producers and studios vision. Director has made a lot of good horror movies which I like a lot. Seemingly the guy can technically make a fast paced action films like this one too but the end result lacks charisma and is very messy with music video style fast cuts, shaky cams, ""camera rolls"" and what not. This is a movie for ADHD generation for sure since its mostly hard to make out anything what's happening on the screen. Viewer is filled with constant stream of V8 growl, fist fights, missiles blowing up, cars flying trough mountain cliffs, cars flying trough sky scrapers, ... well you get the point. You can leave your brains home if you go see this. There is very little drama or calm moments and when there is such, the dialog is juvenile and ultra clichéd. ""I should have done that long time ago"", ""I belong home and I love you forever after"", etc etc. Such poor and uninspired writing. Even much poorer than I though is possible for this franchise.So the script was pretty ridiculous with a lot taken from James Bond, Oceans Eleven series or your generic buddy agent film. I guess they are starting to run out of ideas if they have to transform a street racing subculture film into an agent romp with bullets flying. FF was never about guns or ""breaking in to top secret facility with a team of highly skilled specialist"". Script was just all over the place with explosions, fist fights, going to random places, throwing forgettable one liners... That saddened me. Cars and racing culture were not in the limelight. I was so begging the film to end midways since there was too much non-stop generic action that I've seen million times before. There is absolutely nothing new and memorable in this film you haven't seen in any b-class action movie already. Physics and realism were totally forgot and people jumped from high speed moving cars to asphalt, rolled 100 meters down a mountain cliff, had head-to-head car crash, got hit multiple times with iron bar, flew from fourth floor landing on top of a car, and all this without characters barely sustaining a scratch! Wow. This is actually more superhero movie than Avengers because you can't kill those guys! I expect mindless action movies at least have a decent respect to laws of physics and human body. Oh yeah, and then there was a scene with cars dropped from a plane and landing perfectly on the tiny road many kilometers below them. Just splendid... Also the action and sfx wasn't that spectacular either and I'm truly baffled how they managed to spend 190M on this. They actually used stickers as ""bullet holes"" on cars in many shots. Last time I saw that being done was some Steven Seagal movie from 90s. Surely there was lots of cars being wrecked but somehow it all seemed bland perhaps because of fast cutting or shaky cam. I will give this 4 instead of 3 just because of the touching montage and salute they put for Paul Walker at the end. Too damn shame that he passed away since I liked him a lot as an actor and he seemed like a nice guy. He would have deserved a lot better movie than this unmemorable piece of action mess."
4,"This was one movie I've waited a long time to see. And it just didn't live up to the expectations. My taste may be a bit different then the general audience, but for me The first one and even Tokyo Drift were the gems. This one had a mwah ending but for the rest... its just plain silly. From someone who can enjoy a superhero movie without saying thats not possible, nor is that.. this one made me say it almost the entire movie.I hope the series stops now. I cant see any way they could bring the spice back in as it had before. If you want to see this movie.... wait till it comes on Netflix or some sort. It really isn't worth the time."
4,I didn't liked the movie at all they lost it after fast and furious 4 in my opinion all the other movies they are about the money i liked the scene with Vin and Paul. I liked how they said goodbye ... But it was just very bad the story was ..... no words they shouldn't make a new movie but they will again only for the money ... Watch it if your a fan of the movies but i don't think you will like it a lot. I was expecting again more from the movie and in the end i was like why i payed to see this movie.... Vin played good and the other cast but the brother of Paul i didn't liked him so much i think he is not an actor (i read it somewhere)
4,"I saw a couple of the early Fast & Furious movies, but this is the first one I've seen in a few years. Was a little surprised about how many of the original cast are still in the movies. Having taken a look at some of the actors biographies this is even more surprising.The fact that this is the first of the Fast & Furious movies I've seen in a few years indicates that it isn't a genre that I'm passionate about. The plot and script take a resounding second fiddle to the action. The movie follows the revenge of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who's brother must have been killed by the gang in a previous movie. The action sequences are undoubtedly what the movie is all around. There is absolutely no doubt that if you loved the previous franchise movies you'll love this one as well!! Bearing in mind the box office figures it seems that there are plenty of people who love this movie."
4,"I went to see this last night and I have to say I was really looking forward to it, when I came out of the cinema all I could think is why the hell did I want to go see that so much!!Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Joker but thats pretty much the only positive I can say about this.The film is 2 hours long and I can honestly say I was totally bored for the first 90 minutes, the last half hour is better but not by much. I found myself looking at my watch thinking when is it going to start, where is the gruesome violence that apparently makes people leave the cinema, in short it's not really there, I think they were leaving because they were bored."
4,"Don't fall for it this movie is totally overhyped, borders between boring and irritating. Joaquin is good but the movie has no story and goes on aimlessly. Joaquin's behavior and crazy laughter is so repetitious. Who wrote those 10 star reviews?? Maybe family and friends of the people that worked on the movie??????"
4,"The acting is good but they waste the movie time with repeating the same subject there is a missing part in movie to give attention to the storyline
Just watched him laughing only and the repeated it many times for nothing
Actually i did not complete the last 10 minutes as it was boring and each time tried to leave i was saying just give it another 10 minutes maybe something will happen but really nothing"
4,"A mentally ill person without talents (or intelligence) cannot become a super villain just because he is angry. He will only be a mentally ill person with no talents (and intelligence) in anger. Nothing more. As a film, Joker lacks creativity or depth. In all senses. Unfortunately Joker did for the iconical character the same thing that Twilight did for vampire films."
4,"Travis Bickle is also an anti-hero like Arthur Fleck, so many bad things at once, a product of the times, but his actions are never justified or rendered aspirational either through plot or aesthetics of the film. The same goes for Rupert Pupkin in Scorsese's another masterpiece 'The King of Comedy' from which Todd Philips, the director, heavily borrows but without any proper insight or thought. Class divide, neurological issues, childhood trauma and all that glitter is thrown in the movie to disguise the shallow depth of ideas and adds to the confusion. The film tries to be so many things and ends up being none. 'Poser' would be a better title.Joaquin Phoenix's acting is everything though. Very familiar but still feels fresh and knocks your socks off (and oh that laugh is haunting) and he was the singular reason I didn't walk out of the film after the first 15 minutes because the moment Arthur Fleck commits the third murder (and which obviously was not a self-defense tactic), I thought, ""lo beta, ghus gaye na ghhade me! Yahan se impossible hai nikalna."" And making my worst fears come true, this humorless film just kept on digging that first act grave.So, in short: Loved Joker. Just hated the film he was in.PS: Watch HBO's 'Succession' if you want to take notes on how to have a people as your protagonists, humanize them and still maintain that much-necessary ironic distance from them."
4,"Is it just me or does anyone over 30 see they kind of ripped off ""the King of Comedy (1982)""?"
4,"Joker is the main adversary of Batman. Going back to the 60s where tv where he was crazy and wicked, each version on the big screen has gone up a notch. Jack showed brillance and wicked as did Heath. Their ability to compete with a brilliant Batman was not just based on being the evil Batman, but his equal in brain power.Not so with this pychopath, who was been damaged so bad he shows no intelligence. Just pure evil. And that is not what the Joker is. This Joker is an embarressment and when you walk out of the movie you will know this is not the Joker, this is Michael Myers in clown face.Some of the plot is well thought out, making the rich the true evil and blaiming everything on Thomas Wayne, and Mom Fleck, and bullies and everyone else. And Joker ""coming out"" by killing 3 sleezeball ""stock trader"" types that brought all of this on themselves. The first 2 deserved it and it would have been self defence, but then he hunted down and shot the third in the back as he was trying to get away. From there it was just a horror movie with clownface. Then the upset mobs, tired of their lot in life make him their hero. Kinda like OJ and Trump.No it's not political Joker says, but yes it is. It is preachy and a terrible movie."
4,"Rating 4.5/10
I just buy ticket from PREMIUM HALL to see this movie because previously i saw a good reviews from IMDB. The previews of this movie make you want to see it, but it wasn't nearly as good as i expected it to be. The character of Joaquin Phoenix who is obviously suffering from mental illness is really bad and annoying !! I truly do not understand the high rating on this film. Very disappointing."
4,"As they say, it's been a pleasure. Well, it hasn't. Fine acting, cinematography but beyond that it's a little off the hook over the top.Firstly, he seems 40+ atleast & in these long years as him being him surely faced multiple social awkwardness & behavioural traumas which have made him adapt & understand the world around. But it the movie it looked like he was born yesterday & all the mean things happening for the first time right when the plot started.
The crazy behavior looked unnecessary, forced & unrealistic as mentally challenged folks keep social distancing, don't believe that loud in public. Just because you want to put a crazy guy on screen doesn't make it justified.
Secondly, his anger towards society was unclear. He had his mother, a job best to his potential along with a home given the entire city was all hell loose. What's he complaining about, anyways.
Third, Gotham city is no Buddha city and by judging the madness around why wouldn't you search a guy before letting on national TV more so as the sole reason for him bieng invited to the show was him being wack job.There are certain points worth mentioning.
1. Long.
2. Dull storyline.
3. Pointless plot.
4. Misinterpretation of human psychology.
5. Unpleasant to watch.
6. Unjustified character development.
7. Being silly, when someone fires a gun on LIVE TV you don't send one cop car.
8. Lastly, how in Gods name did the two investigating officers landed up asking for him regarding the subway shootout while half the city is on rampage?
9. Did anyone else observe Joaquin's body was all bones yet his cheek fat intact. Strange anatomy.Go watch it or don't. Your choice. Judge yourself according to your taste & pocket. Good,Bad are abstract concepts. Each has it's own opinion & logic based on it's level of knowledge. Don't buy along the concept of influencer.
Lastly, Joaquin did do some fine fine acting.
Thanks for reading."
4,"OK, the story is nice and the acting is excellent. But the movie suffers from three bad things:1- Boring and uninteresting dialog. There are a lot of them.2- Too slow pace.3- Too lengthy. Too much time for very little number of ideas.These three things combined are more than enough to destroy any movie. It is the first time I have felt that I need to look at the watch to know how much left for the movie to end. Beside this, the genre is supposed to be a thriller in addition to crime and drama, but it is too far from being a thriller.I cannot understand the exaggerated high ratings for this movie. I want to be fair with it. So although it is boring, I give it 4 stars for the story and the acting, but definitely the movie does not worth 5 stars or more. Consequently, I cannot recommend this movie."
4,"You know I really wanted to like this film, but to me the plot was a let down and Joaquin Phoenix's performance while good didn't quite match the hype. It had great production, the cinematography, sound production and editing were all good.
I didn't buy into this character becoming a criminal mastermind, there was no hint of this guy having the intelligence the Joker is known, there was no plan to his actions, just reaction to his situation, unhinged reaction but nothing more. And there was no wacky monologues the Joker is know for, not it even a hint of it.
I was going to say it left me wanting more but no, I can't see me giving this incarnation of the joker anymore of my time."
4,"Is it that the Joker is justified in becoming a serial killer because he was abused as a child and was attacked on the street and on the subway?Or is he justified in becoming a mass murderer because people didn't laugh at his jokes, and a famous person made fun of him on TV about not being funny?Or is it that we should be more careful about letting a mentally disturbed person get a gun?Or is it that we should prevent a private person from giving a gun to someone else without official background checks?Or is it that our society is so messed up that one logical response is to become a wacked-out maniac who goes around murdering people who have done him wrong?Or is it something else?One thing it is NOT, is entertainment. This movie is about as enjoyable as swimming in sewage.The 4 stars is because it was well-written, the plot was logical, and it succeeded in making you feel bad for the Joker. And because Joaquin Phoenix did a great acting job.But what is the point of this movie? Is it to say that we must stand by as society collapses into a putrid mess? That the bad guy will ultimately win? No thanks."
4,"JOKER character should have been much better presented in a more psycho-path life. Suffering like in the movie is not a good cause for such a character to rise. I expected a lot from a movie rated over 9, and really disappointed with it. We were 8 watching and 4 said not worth the ticket. Hoaquin did a great job, but the scenario and directing were poor."
4,"Not sure if the controversy of the film was justified. Have people forgotten taxi driver? This is nothing new and as a comic book film it falls flat. Phoenix is great in the role but there just wasn't enough to go on and it was a muddled mess. I expected so much more from all the hype this film had and maybe that's why I'm just not impressed by it. It's worth a watch for sure but with no sequel... ""THE END"" and no Batman film to incorporate it with, then honestly what was the point anyway?"
4,"Honestly people who have rated this movie as a ""masterpiece"" need to start watching some actual masterpieces. Predictable over indulgent and simplistic (not in a good way). You could see every ""climax"" 10 mins before it happens. Good things and why I have it 4. 1.Score 2.Cinematography 3.Art direction 4.Music choiceFilm makers need to start making some good films!"
4,"The movie is just so sad. I felt uncomfortable, sad and depressed the entire time. Is that what the movie was supposed to do? Yea sure. But I left the movie theatre with such a gut wrenching feeling in my stomach and I cried for about an hour. It is two hours that will make you feel awful and sad, but the ending is kinda cool."
4,"I must say I'm disappointed. I love the Batman universe and especially the story behind Joker. Considering it's been a lot of talk around this movie, I expected more. The first half of the movie was pretty long drawn, towards the end it was great but not so much before that in my opinion. They could have done so much more with the time they had.
Also, something that I struggle with is that every move Joker made was very predictable basic psychology (my opinion). Joker isn't supposed to be predictable, that is a part that makes him so interesting. Besides from all that the actor did an amazing job potraying Joker!"
4,"Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie ""Joker"" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch ""Joker"". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't. It wasn't all that particularly outstanding or entertaining. Sure, it is a movie about an iconic villain in the DC universe, but that is about as far as it goes.I am rating this overhyped and overrated movie a less than mediocre four out of ten stars."
4,"The popularity and the high ratings centered around this movie is due to Heath Ledger's successful portrayal of the Joker character. While Heath's performance was A-Class, it was still somewhat overrated due to his suicide and alleged but never-confirmed gossip about his suicide relating to his portrayal of Joker.Joaquin Phoenix has been a drama queen and did some weird stuff on TV to regain his lost popularity and therefore people slowly began to see him as an offbeat rogue actor and this allowed him to take on the Joker role.The movie itself, tries to make profit from Phoenix's cooked up antics by always trying to close in on his face while he is moaning or trying to laugh in an out of the ordinary matter.Heath Ledger's character was successful but the camera was never too much in his face. His laughter and his aura spread naturally. However in Phoenix's Joker, director Todd Phillips tried to capitalize too much on the hype of Phoenix's real life antics and Heath Ledger's successful Joker performance by always zooming in on Joker's face in a way to force his mentally unstable state upon the viewers rather then letting the viewesr decide for themselves.On the other hand, the movie is very slow and has unexplainable plot holes. Not recommended."
4,"Joker is anything but a masterpiece, although it certainly takes itself seriously enough and it tries harder than any movie in recent memory to be one (maybe the recent Star is Born tries harder). But I found it largely languorous, psychopathic in its intent and subsequent failure to move me on any level and, well, not worth even a laugh.I don't know what the point of this film is, since it doesn't really work as Batman lore, providing a shoddy psychological construct around the Joker's origins, and if the idea was to top either Nicholson or Ledger it failed me (Nolan's Joker vision is far more nihilistic, seemingly coming from nowhere, with a twisted, brutal sense of humor about him.) Here we are meant to empathize with poor disgruntled Arthur Fleck, which might have been easier had he not been fed so many obvious motivations for his disgruntlement, and propped up by such lazy writing.If Joker is meant to 'be a mirror' to our times, it fails again, to say anything relevant or novel about society, or about the US, or the mental health system or anything really that hasn't been said a million times before, and instead seems focused on taking itself really really seriously, and wants us to find sequences of the Joker dancing to Gary Glitter edgy and bombastic, when really these sequences are dull and incongruent deadweight.Fans will lambast the haters of this film, but frankly I was bored by its flat embrace of pointless amorality. I wanted better, more biting satire, more layers, more motivation. Instead we get superficial, ultra-violent and pointless dreck which says and means nothing, even while it looks swell, has a great cast and seemingly all the ingredients are in order. But maybe that's the trade off for giving the reigns of such a film to the Hangover director."
4,"I respect the unusual effort to try and do a movie about a comic book supervillain. But, the Joker still remains largely a cipher. Sure he's crazy, a bit tortured, and he loves anarchy. The problem is, it is all style and no substance. A movie about a crazy person being crazy isn't that interesting, enlightening or entertaining. Having a character that has traumatic brain injury as the driving cause of his delusions and schizophrenia doesn't really work. What makes the Joker an intriguing character is ability to see ourselves (just a little bit) in the character. Which is why the Joker is more interesting as a character who reached his breaking point and went totally over to the ""dark side."" Sorta like Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down."" He clearly has shades of Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver"" in him, but that character's descent to the dark side was MUCH more interesting.The movie lightly touches on some interesting themes, but the finale isn't earned. The self-aware soliloquy at the end isn't earned. Indeed, that awareness is contrary the back story that was developed. But, in the end it has enough style in the direction and acting to keep your attention. But, it needed a lot more than a cooky, dancing, skinny Joaquin Phoenix to make it work. Although it was a different type of movie, I still think Heath Ledger's Joker was much better."
4,"This is first movie I watched and review on this site. Well, watch this movie if you have absolutely little else to do. I found it very boring, longish, and at the end of the movie in theatre I was about to fall asleep. This boring it was. I mean people, you better entertain yourself watching washing machine going, two hours straight. Would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is just boring as hell."
4,"Really can not see what the fuss was about with this movie, especially compared to some movies which are only receiving 5 or 6 stars 😂"
4,"This movie has already been done, and much more successfully. 'Nightcrawler' set the standard for lonely-sociopath-craves-recognition movies and 'Joker' comes nowhere near its impact.
While 'Nightcrawler' avoids creating any sort of sympathy for the character, 'Joker' dares us NOT to feel sorry for him. It can't (or won't) go the extra mile and simply create a character with no redeeming features, which is exactly what the Joker should be. Instead, it insists on pulling at our heart strings by filling the first half of the movie with endless scenes of sorrow and misery for the character.
It is nothing more than a sugar-coated vision by the director, and Phoenix, while doing admirable work with what little he was given,just comes across as pathetic and haphazard. Almost like each scene was created on the spot."
4,"I was so sad after watching the movie because I had such high expectations. I absolutely love Joker in the Batman movies, in the cartoon, even in suicide squad. Joaquins acting is outstanding, but the movie is nothing like I expected. 75% of the movie portrays how depressing his life is, which made the movie feel like it was going on forever. It was unnecessary. The last 15-20 minutes was really good, because that's when the action started coming in.For more fancy movie watchers it may be a masterpiece, but for a simple Batman fan it was just boring."
4,"My Rating : 4/10Extremely average movie, OK for a one-time viewing.The high ratings are absolutely fake according to me. The story also has been embellished to confuse the facts for cinematic effect. A real downer!I am not 'H-A-P-P-Y' after watching it - that's for sure!"
4,"There is some really good acting from all the principals in this film, but the direction is slow and shoddy and the script itself calls for too many shots of people changing gears, cars moving around the track, etc. Equally disappointing is the failure to once mention the Corvette, the raison d'etra for the Mustang in the first place."
4,"Technically dazzling and well-acted film, but the script is a dull thud. Scenes are often contrived, sometimes exasperingly so, such as when Ken Miles (Christian Bale) explaiins the details of the Le Mans circuit to his son (Noah Jupe), or Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) demonstrates the need for a first-rate driver to Henry Ford II (excellent Tracy Letts). Come on, writers! Couldn't you do better than this?Very much a boy's adventure pic with a slight seasoning of 'vulnerable man' stuff thrown in as a sop to 21st century sensibilities. In the only female role of any consequence, Caitriona Balfe is strong and supportive, but, for all the difference her character makes to the story, she might just as well not be there.In the manner of all films about motor racing (e.g. GRAND PRIX, John Frankenheimer's 1966 movie), the race footage is what it's all about, and some of FORD v FERRARI's is genuinely thrilling. The story that surrounds it, interesting though it is, inevitably seems tame by comparison."
4,"Racing unrealistically slow, car movements all wrong, exaggerated acting, too long, predictable. Proud American sort of Vietnam war movie feel.Wanted to like it. Some good scenes. Rather shocked by how most seemed to love it. We are all different, aren't we!"
4,This is really not have very good movie. It is really sad. The story line is not that good. It is not an 8.3. It is a 4. Come on now I can watch new and see car crash. It is not that good really.
4,"The thing I kept hearing about 'Ford v Ferrari' was that even if you're not into the car racing side of things there is enough other stuff going on to keep you entertained. I can confirm that was not correct information. This movie is two and half hours long and the entire thing is about motor sports. If you don't like motor sports, this film will not be to your liking. You can appreciate things about it like Matt Damon and Christian's Bale's fine acting, but overall this will likely not be a pleasant experience for you.The film has been nominated for Best picture at the Academy Awards. I was a little surprised by that. I think it speaks more to a weaker year in terms of good films than anything else. This would easily be the worst of the nine nominated films and the least likely to win. It ticks none of the boxes required to compete for the win and is simply there as filler. If Bale had been nominated in an acting category I would have seen that as a more worthy nomination.The biggest problem I had with the film is that we are asked to side with Ford. Ferrari are shown to be scumbags - the only problem is that Ford are as well. So why should we root for them? Simply because we are told to? That was incredibly poor writing and something that was hard to get past. If you are smart enough to realise that Ford aren't worth supporting then you are left with 150 minutes of film runtime about something you couldn't care less about. The ending was cheesy and out of character, the film was predictable and the tone was uneven and hard to settle in to. This is not a film I would recommend seeing unless you are a motor sport fanatic."
4,"This movie makes me hate Ford. I wish I would've known that this has a sad ending, I would not have gone to see it. Very disappointing movie."
4,Matt Damon slayed it. Enjoyed Christian Bale. Caitriona Balfe is a one dimensional Actor doesn't really add to Movie other than they needed a woman character for the Movie. She needs more acting classes or something
4,"First of all, you expect a conflict between the two adversaries mentioned in the versus that happens to be the movie's title, right? Nope...Wrong. This movie is all about Ford and the struggle of creating GT40. All the conflict and drama awaits you in the Ford section. Ferrari name is like a clickbait in lame internet portals: ""You won't believe what Enzo Ferrari said when Henry Ford tried to buy Ferrari"" :PWe literally see almost nothing from the Ferrari side. Well, I don't blame them for this cheap hoax because firstly I know from my very own experience that no one grew up with dreams of owning a Ford. We dreamed of Ferrari. Far fewer people would watch this movie if only the Ford name was mentioned in the title.Leaving this ""title nonsense"" behind, I can confidently say that two of my favorite actors Damon and Bale have both presented decent but slightly poor performance compared to their average. Plot is weak and painfully predictible even if you haven't heard of a machine called ""car"" before. In addition to that, unnecessary length gave me this crazy idea that if I would cut this movie into 3 second long pieces and reunite them in the order of 1-3-5-7 and 2-4-6-8, I would probably have 2 half length, almost identical movies without losing full version's essence. That would be my director's cut I guess. Long story short, you won't miss much if you don't watch it but if you like this specific genre, it wouldn't hurt to spare 2,5 hours of your time. I didn't hate the movie. It was just far behind what it offered with it's cast, 8+ star rating, fantastic reviews and so on."
4,"Okay, half of the movie was just nonsense conversation, but I got really into the races."
4,I am a motorsports professional . . . network radio and print . . . and have personally covered both the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring . . . and endurance racing is nothing like what was presented in this movie. I'm sorry . . . this was a complete load of utter crap.
5,"Sure, a lot of people are going to like cars falling out of the sky. Sure they going to like things blowing up over and over again. Some will find ""Awesome"" the special effects. Most will.Not me. The fast and furious franchise has gone trough some changes since it first installment. Since the return of the original cast in the fourth movie, the tone has changed, and ""popcorn"" action privileged over a strong story. But it was well done. Still keeping the ""buddy-touch"" the charismatic characters, raising one from the death in the 6 th movie, and also keeping some sentiment.But every movie, kept going in a stronger direction of ""you not believe what you will see"", but also in more and more nonsense. As the balance was still fine in the fourth, the fifth had just some ""over the top"" situations, The 6 th, was for me limit of ""believable moments"", but OK, it was still fun.Now, the movie in unbelievable from start to end. The situations are so overdone, and have no gram of realism. On the contrary what happen to Paul Walker in real life, the can fall from heights, crashed in cars many time, they will all be running around as nothing ever happen. Action is fine with me, but please give us a story we can believe in!Then I not know how Paul Walker death affected the final result. First, on many occasions, I had the impression it was not him, which of course is true. The theft of the car in the building, the fight with the Thai movie-star, Walker's face was either not really visible, or then not realistic, like a video game character. Sure, because of the circumstances, still well done, but visible.Where it affects probably the most is the ""buddy feeling"" of the movie and the dialogs between him and ""Vin Diesel"", were almost non existent. Vin is deciding everything, Walker, is just there to execute, probably because, their conversations were not all shot yet. And that is more difficult to artificially create, when people are not running or driving around. Loud Fireworks, crashing cars, a lot of action, not always make an exiting movie, like mentioned before, especially when what is happening is so much over the top. You not fear for your heroes any more, because, and I not say this ironically, they are not people of flesh and blood any more, but super heroes like Superman, that seem stronger then a normal human being. And that was for me the strength of F&F before, just ordinary guys, getting in a difficult situation."
5,"to sum it up in few words i must say this latest installment in the franchise is a mash up and mixture of James Bond 007,mission impossible series and pretty much all those films that Michael Bay directed we have seen over the years is equal to furious 7.why here are some of the reasons since 2001 the first installment came things changed in films if you go back and look at Rob Cohen's original you will find a balance later on directors changed and Justin Lin took over the franchise which was a good thing but the tone started to change it changed from the racing and heist element to the sake of action and new villains were introduced in each next chapter but they at least they tried there best at being stuck to some realism while this 7th film tried to included everything & ended up ruining itself.the cast:new members are added here Paul Walker passed away in 2013 in midway filming this was his last film but he looks great here doing action but his character cant do much here,Vin Diesel looked bored here seriously he should make the triple x sequel these films are enough now,the rock role is chopped off he gets beat up so bad and only appear in the climax blowing everything up he stole the whole drone & helicopter scene but the biggest highlights are Kurt Russell,Nathalie Emmanuel & finally my favorite Jason Statham he is so bad-ass here i thought i was watching a transporter sequel but sadly he is not used well he is not the main villain here,Elsa Patkay is here too but in a changed hairstyle but what i hated the most was role for Tony Jaa he gets wasted here this guy is a icon.The Plot:Deckard Shaw is after Dom and his family because they let his brother Owen Shaw left for dead just as Dom is about to deal with Shaw he gets in between a war with Somalian terrorists and government agents.for those who don't know Han died at end of Tokyo Drift 2006 and the events of fast and furious 2009,fast five 2011 & furious 6 2013 happened before that this begins right some time after Tokyo drift story Tokyo drift is my personal favorite film most underrated in franchise.let me be clear on one thing i did like the action here but at many times they were over the top critics will love it for sure but when same thing John Woo does it these hypocrites hate it i mean the Dubai building to building car stunt is insane it looks epic but hello guys not even Daniel Craig do this type of action as 007 the shaky camera wont bother as there is plenty of dialog and chemistry of actors with each other is enjoyable the scrip is to be blamed here seriously all these elements like technology and those comic book type stunts were not necessary if they had kept it little simple just like the first film in 2001 it would have been much better.the crowd was enjoying it no doubt but the guys need to be careful in future the edited needs to be tighter so the narrative wont go loose cannon the micro chip plot was not required at all Jason Statham's character is ignored here on purpose furious 7 tried hard to go back to the roots but what can anybody do these guys added too many stories in one film this is not avengers or batman please.this films is for adrenaline junkie fans only universal should remove James wan and bring some other director next time otherwise the fast and the furious series are done for.Overall Furious 7 2015 is a half good half bad film just don't expect a masterpiece that's all i have to say enjoy it for what it is my rating is 5/10:Recommended"
5,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""For Paul"". A touching tribute to the late Paul Walker provides an emotional end to the most high-octane (sorry about that) F&F episode yet  and the perfect victory lap (sorry again) for the franchise. Of course, we know that it won't be the last, if for no other reason than easy box office money.The franchise began in 2001, and the familiar faces are back: Vin Diesel as Dom, Paul Walker as Brian, Jordana Brewster as Brian's wife Mia, Michelle Rodriguez as amnesiac Letty, Tyrese Gibson and Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges as comic relief Roman and Tej, respectively, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Agent Hobbs. New to the scene are Djimon Honsou as a terrorist, Ronda Rousey and Tony Jaa as elite henchmen (henchpersons?), Nathalie Emmanuel as super-hacker Ramsey, and Kurt Russell as the shadowy government-type cutting shady deals for fuzzy reasons. The biggest add is of course, Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw, the Black Ops big brother to Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) – silenced villain from the previous film (in which Statham made a brief appearance foreshadowing this story line).Achieving remarkable success for what started as a fun little street racing cult film, this series thrives on its familiar characters, simple plot lines, staggering lineup of dream cars, and ever-louder and larger stunts, fights and set pieces. One of the earliest scenes features a fight scene that would be the climax of most action movies: The Rock vs Jason Statham. Rather than end or solve anything, this fight merely serves as a set-up for one of the film's punchlines – involving The Rock and a plaster arm cast (pay no attention to that leg cast). In the middle, we get a too brief clash between Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey, but the real finale is a rooftop battle between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that has such an extended cut-away, we almost forget they are going at each other.In between those colossal fights, we get Paul Walker sprinting up the side of a bus that is sliding off a cliff, a wicked and armed drone, car chases galore – including one with a stealth chopper, synchronized10,000 foot car drops from an airplane, and most impressively, car jumps between the Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi. That last one is not just any car, but a stunning red Lykan Hypersport  one with little resale value after its final trip.Michelle Rodriguez' character is fighting her amnesia, Ludicrous and Tyrese play off each other like Laurel and Hardy, while Dom does his best Yoda impression, and Statham comes off like a revenge-seeking missile from a Terminator movie. Every character gets their fair share of posing, preening, strutting and smirking. It would be an insult to call this over-the-top because that would imply we have previously seen the top. This is high-speed, high-altitude mayhem that plays directly to a large fan base.Personally, I'm not a devout F&F follower, and have seen only the first entry prior to this latest. My attendance for Furious 7 was driven (get it?) by my interest in seeing the tribute to Walker, and my personal code of seeing every Kurt Russell movie (don't ask). However, I do understand the mass appeal, and I believe the followers will appreciate the approach of director James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring), who replaces 3 time series director Justin Lin."
5,"They topped everything they did in previous F&F I grant them that. It doesn't make it a good movie though, and certainly not the best of the series."
5,"The whole movie franchise of Fast and Furious is probably one of the most memorable ones. However, as it is nearing the end, the franchise is becoming nothing more than a Science Fiction cliché.In this specific movie the whole plot is based on both lack of common sense and bad physics. Nearly every stunt and every piece of action was not supported by the right laws of physics. The illogical plot made me feel a bit stupid. At one point I felt like I was watching a Marvel movie, something like The Avengers. This wouldn't be so bad if it were for cars racing on the streets, you know, the thing that we all fell in love with.On the other hand, this particular movie contains a witty atmosphere, something I've not really felt while watching the previous parts. The acting is great, as you would expect, the portrayed characters felt like having real-life emotions which is pretty rare in a purely action movie.All in all I give this movie a 5/10. This might be harsh due to my love for physics. The only downside is the lack of logic. If you're a fan of the previous parts go ahead and watch this movie that ended with a heart melting scene. It is worth a watch."
5,"Directed by James Wan. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Tyrese Gibson, Dwayne Johnson, Nathalie Emmanuel, Kurt Russell, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Elsa Pataky, Ronda Rousey, Tony Jaa. (PG-13)The gearhead gang is back once again (excuse me, ""family""), this time taking turns pursuing and being pursued by the brother (Statham) of the last baddie they took down. The street racing component is limited to a single brief scene at the beginning; the rest of the time, they're just IMF with hotter cars and smaller vocabularies (an undercover heist at a party in Abu Dhabi feels at times like a plagiarism of the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise). If the last few outings were really dumb, this one is just plain stupid--raucous fun in fits and bursts, but too long, too over-the-top, too overstuffed, with flashy but pointless camera movements masking a firm sense of space, geography and logic. Less mayhem would have been a good thing, none of Gibson would have been a great thing. A few familiar faces make brief appearances, but the real stars will always be the cars and stunts; it's just a shame that so many of those stunts are too obviously staged/digitized and too physically impossible to legitimately thrill. Johnson is sidelined for most of the movie, but his bicep flex during the climax is one for the ages. Walker's final film, and the fitting farewell that caps the film is handled with surprising sensitivity.47/100"
5,It was a little boring I was expecting more exciting
5,"Perhaps it was naive to expect much in this genre, but given rather complimentary reviews I took the chance. What a disappointment. Throwing money at a movie gets you lots of gruff & buff; big explosions, amazing stunts, scores of hotties and all the predictable stuff in this type of movie. Is it too much to ask for a decent plot, clever dialogue and some acting with a pinch of believability? Not short on eye candy & raising the pulse from time to time, but the obvious weaknesses in the plot & events, coupled with corny & insipid dialogue and some b-grade acting made this a rather tedious two hours. Never been so disappointed in a Metacritic rating before."
5,"Furious 7 is the  seventh installment in the Fast and Furious franchise. Watching it makes it obvious that it has come a very long way from its 2001 days. It is loud, violent, and emotional, something that the previous films all seemed to strive towards but never could achieve to the degree that Furious 7 did. But was it too much? Was the decision to turn a small franchise about crime and street racing into a massive, apocalyptic film with insane, death-defying stunts even a good idea? Well, sure. But not to the extent of Furious 7. It is too loud, too violent, and too serious. Jason Statham removes all the lightness of the previous films with his sneering, annoying, black-op juggernaut vibe, while the clanking and smashing brings back cold-sweat nightmares of a casual trip to the imagination of Michael Bay. It almost makes me yearn for a delicate drama, something where the words are not canned and meaningless, where the meaning is complex, and where Jason Statham is in a world far removed from it. Which isn't to say the film is awful. It is stylish, funny, and sexist as always, filled with fancy cars and gasp-inducing moments. But I just think it takes it a bit too far, especially in its fighting scenes and the apparent invincibility of all the characters. They survive rollovers with a few scratches, getting hit in the face with wrenches with little cuts, and getting hit with bottles with little as much as a small moan. And whenever they get hit the theater fills with a massive, crunching thud that eventually gets hard to take.Here's the story in a nutshell. Owen Shaw's (villain from FAF6) big brother (Deckard Shaw) decides to take his revenge on Dominic Toretto and his crew for crippling his brother. Han is revealed to have been killed by Mr. Shaw, and Dominic is now Shaw's new target. Of course, Dominic is mad as heck. No one targets his family and lives to not go to jail.The film ends with the words ""For Paul"" as we knew it would. The death of Paul Walker left everyone (or at least me) confused at how it would even be possible to make Furious 7 in the first place. But as I watched the sensitive, tasteful tribute at the end of the film, I began to feel a sort of emptiness. The tribute, I realized, was for the character, Brian O' Connor. Paul Walker was just who the film was dedicated to. The inescapable hypocrisy of the film began to become painfully evident.How did Paul Walker die? He was in a car accident involving a car driving at an insane velocity. He was killed going too fast. And yet, we glorify him in a film that is all about driving fast, and shows it to be completely safe. Nobody even gets hurt after driving off cliffs, crashing into trees, or driving out of buildings. By supporting this mentality, we are not honouring Paul Walker. We are contributing to his folly.The best way to honour him would be to not finish Furious 7, and to quietly abandon the franchise."
5,"Man, I got to tell you, I was pleasantly surprised by the last two Fast and the Furious films and when I went to see this one, I was really excited, when I saw it....eh? I mean, yeah, the film is decent. I guess my biggest problem with the film is the lack of story. There is so much story that is substituted for needless chase and explosions, and I know that is kind of the point of the Fast and Furious franchise but in the last two films, what worked was the development of the characters as well as the introduction and development of new characters and villains such as Hobbs or Shaw.Here, you are promised prominent Hollywood bad asses, Jason Statham, Tony Jaa and Djmion Honsou (one of my favorite actors) and they get no development and are all shoehorned into several different plot lines that add up to nothing more than a few fight scenes that you honestly don't care about. Also, the film really exploits how much it can get away with in terms of action, they did it before but here it gets somewhat distracting. I hear Denzel Washington turned down Kurt Russell's role and with the way he is written, I can see why. He was REALLY ANNOYING.The film's one saving grace is its ending. I won't give it away but it is a very heart warming send off to Paul Walker, and you can feel it was coming from the hearts of his co-stars. They also dealt with the CGI of Paul Walker's face very well.Overall, Fast 7 is a fun film, a popcorn film and you probably won't want to watch it again."
5,"This movie is very much like porn - discardable story, poor acting and dialogues, and a bunch of loosely related hot action scenes.I really don't get the high ratings. The movie is ridiculous. I think the high scores are only some kind condolences for Paul Walker.The movie has basically no story - whatever story it has only serves to connect the action scenes. It feels like a bunch of disconnected shots. The plot is very unrealistic and is not believable. There is no development or anything. We are supposed to take their word for the characters. They have muscles so they must be tough mean super humans. For example the development of the main villain is basically one shot.The characters and the story are full of clichés and you need serious Hollywood action movie preconditioning to accept them. The action scenes are spectacular but unbelievable and unrealistic. It is just a disposable mindless entertainment, but I wasn't even entertained.The series changed so much. In the first movie the characters were much more down to earth - they were some street gang racers, doing their racing cary stuff. There is nothing of this anymore. There is no even racing, just few random names of car parts. And the cars themselves appear out of nowhere just so that there could be shiny fancy cars to be wrecked.I suppose I would love the movie if I was 12 year old looking for distraction."
5,"First of all, Paul Walker you shall be missed, may you R.I.P. Next is the review. I liked the movie to be honest and I thought it was very enjoyable. It had me laughing from start to finish, but not always in a good way. The movie was presented as epic and thought things would be more epic. There was too much of nothing happening, just explosions in every other scene and a lot of unrealistic non-sense. I don't care who you are, you can't break a cast just by flexing or break the ground by stomping. Another thing is you can't die and come back to life because of someone speaking to you and telling you they love you. And yes as nit picky as that sounds its true. All in all, this movie could have been a lot better and a lot more entertaining without all the extra take up space. I enjoyed the words of good bye to Paul Walker though it really was a tear jerker. I really enjoyed the series, thanks."
5,"Been a huge fan of FF Series, but as they said all good things must come to an end. Unfortunately the end was not great, both literally and on screen,Had high hopes from the movie, and it started with a Bang, a brilliant setup. Alas things went downside right from there. The first action sequence is amazing, but then it just moves into a drag mode. The last sequence is a huge drag, and best seen with a headache pill. If not for the last 5 minutes, i would have probably wanted to curse myself that why did i even come to watch this movie.If you are a huge Paul walker fan you can somehow sit through it, but in case he was alive today, he would probably have acknowledged too that this is not how he would have wanted this series to end. Best Avoided."
5,"Furious six or fast six was in my opinion an irrelevant movie, it was only made to make money and not to tell a story. With furious 7, its just a big mess.Many people rate this movie highly because of Paul Walker, make no mistake this movie gave him a good tribute. But in terms of the franchise, its a horrible entry! The Lines are cheesy as if written by an eight year old. The action scenes are amazing to look at but thats all they are, eye candy! They are not relevant to the plot at all. Deckard shaw was actually intimidating in the first 40 minutes of the movie, but eventually, just gets caught up in a lot of nonsense.The globe trotting is not necessary as it adds nothing to the movie, one minute they are here, the next there, without really making sense. The worst of all is how disappointing this movies final act is. When you watch it you'll see how anti climatic it is. The first fast and furious was good , the second decent, tokyo drift good, fast 4 moderate, fast five excellent, fast six and seven irrelevant. But then again, when going to see fast and furious, you don't go for the story, you go for the visuals."
5,"I had serious high hopes for this movie, I really did. I pretty much like everything. Not only, did this movie not entertain me, It made me angry and sad. I Like Paul Walker movies, including the others in the Fast and Furious series. I own quite a few myself. As I write this review, there is an internal struggle within me because this IS Paul Walkers last movie. His co-stars and the creators of this movie really cared about him and it shows in the end. That being said, this movie really disappointed me. The cars?...awesome. The acting?...not bad. The action?... mostly unrealistic. The best action scenes you will see in the previews and you can save your money.As an example, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is exploded...falls five stories onto the roof of a car...implodes it...and doesn't die. He breaks an arm and a leg. I may have been able to swallow that if it wasn't for the fact that he breaks out of his casts with the explanation that ""daddy's got to go to work"" and runs around the end of the movie holding a chain gun. I seriously didn't know whether to laugh or cry at that point. The crew gets constantly shot at and nothing happens...but when they turn the same weapons on the bad guys...they die horribly. Vehicles drop from extreme heights and don't explode. The fight scenes are brutal with hardly even a scratch. My last example is when Dom is presumed dead at the end. Brian wants to deliver CPR, which is what you should do if someone's heart stops, but instead turns him over to Letty who whispers in his ear and all of the sudden he awakens. The Paul Walker montage at the end is what really upset me, because he will never have a chance to be in another movie worth watching and this is the movie that capped his legacy. Fans of the series will find it watchable but will agree with me as they walk out of the theater or turn off the DVD player."
5,"Let's face it, this movie is popular because of three things: cars,chicks and action. Other major elements like script,story,acting,logic are completely missing.If you can accept this fact and overcome the lack of reality you will have a great time. As far as i'm concerned it is an entertaining, action packed and sometimes funny movie. Most of us know what to expect, so i would like to mention two major problems which made this movie less enjoyable than the previous ones.The biggest problem was the Deja Vu effect. There was a feeling that carried me through the whole movie. I have seen this before and this time they couldn't convince me with stunning moments and spectacular actions. Every moment imitated moments from the previous 3 movies. Every dialogue, every scene summoned elements that i have seen already. It is hard to describe this feeling but it definitely can't be unseen. It ripped off literally everything from itself.The total lack of reality is the other big problem. I know, i know. It is perfectly unnecessary to come up with a thing like this in this case. There is a border of tolerance and after a certain amount of stupidity it can not be ignored anymore. We may call this the Bullsh*t-Meter. My brain can consume 100 bullsh*t/Fast and Furious movie. Once it steps over the line i can not take it anymore. This movie established a new record with infinite number of nonsense. The characters are still racist but after 6 movies i get used to it. However I could barely endure the simple existence of Tyrese Gibson. He wanted to be funny all the time but whatever he said always ended in awkwardness.Action scenes are still amazing and intense, cars still look fabulous, chicks wear even less clothes ... soooo... basically thats it. It is an average action movie with literally nothing else to offer. It is not a bad movie but i do not know what crazy stunts are they going to do in the next one. Maybe Vin Diesel will fight with King Kong on a ship which slides down from the Mount Everest! Who knows?"
5,"Yes there was a lot of action and a lot of crashing cars, trucks, and airplanes. Yes there was a lot of action and shooting and good guys and bad guys, but all in all I can call it just a good action movie. I saw so many of these, similar ones before, that I really can not be impressed very much with repeating action, which increasingly looks the same in all of these expensive action films. Scene, when car is crashing trough three towers is probably the most memorable one. Otherwise, all other scenes looked very much similar to other action films I have seen over the years. If you are a fan of high speed, lots of crashes and no brainier plot, this is a film for you, otherwise, you might freely skip it."
5,"first 15 min of the movie are really promising. you feel a strong premise building. but after that they just assume that the audience have left their brains at home.this time they crossed the fine line between wow and impossible. after a few scenes you realize that the hero is never gonna die, so there is no tension in the scenes. diesel wants to catch statham. statham is there wherever diesel goes, but diesel wants to get a device that will help him find statham. wtf? they destroy everything to kill statham and in the end they don't kill him. wtf? don't waste your precious time and money on this one."
5,"OK I liked the 1st film, I even own it, and as with most films, the ones that followed took a dip.What started as a ""could happen"" soon went down the road of WTF, and yet they were still OK....OK in the way of the action on screen at least looked OK/good.Soon the driving side (car life) slipped, we got more and more action set-ups, each film made the last look more plausible in comparison, each trying to be more WTF than the last.Even with the OK at best story/script, there was still a reason to watch, the big names doing crazy stunts, but some of those big stunts started to get a laugh...not what they set out to do.This brings us to FF7, I did hope that after seeing the trailer, they might have one of the better films, good names, looked like Jason was going to hunt them and thats about it, TBH I would have been more happy if that was all it was.To get to the point the film is (for money spent) a 5/10 at best, the script is shocking, at times I felt bad for some of the actors.Story wise, well it raised a few laughs at how silly it was, they pushed the God Eye thing, no point it even been there, should have just been them vs Jason.Action, a few fights were well done, did enjoy the 1st fight....but that's about it, I found myself laughing at the crazy CGI stuff, the way way way over the top green screen stunts, which when mixed in with a horrible script, well at one point most of the cinema was laughing at a scene that was serious.I started to feel sorry for Paul Walker, I did hope they would have turned out a good film, a film that you might look back on, maybe not as good as the 1st film, but at least better than the others, but by the end it came over as a total mess, and not a fitting way to be remembered."
5,"FAST AND THE FURIOUS 7What do we expect from 'Fast and the Furious' movies? a) Speeding Cars and heists b) Overtly thrilling action sequences c) A good plot which does not make the movie an abrupt affairWith 'The Fast and the Furious:Tokyo Drift', the movie series had taken a side-track from its story-line. But, many should concur that this movie has by far been the benchmark of a quality movie based on racing/car-action. It had all the qualities of this adrenaline- pumping genre and except the heist part, it serves all the expectations of the Fast and the Furious franchise.Anyway, even if beating the benchmark of Tokyo Drift is a far- fetched job, one can surely expect! But, I should confess that I was a bit disappointed with the latest sequel, i.e FF7. Many would like to say that it is good that the latest sequel does not include street-races, as they seem childish. But, I had always been a fan of this franchise because of those street races (Need for Speed games being the trigger for it), and lately I've been disappointed with the movie plots which do not include those 'childish' races.So in this sequel, speeding cars and heists - Yes. Races - No.Coming to the part about thrilling action sequences, yes the movie delivers on that. Most of the scenes are top-notch and nasty, and as it goes, unbelievable. Obviously more 'fantastic' than 'gutsy'. The sad part is, a good chunk of it was already there in the trailer. And lastly, the plot. Well, in layman's terms, it is bullshit ! You'd probably cry almost every 10 minutes uttering, ""What the hell is happening?"". At one moment Dwayne Johnson is hospitalized with serious injuries; in another, he rips off his plaster and goes on firing the villains with machine guns. Well obviously, he is 'The Rock'! An actor like Jason Statham seems a sidekick in the plot. And then again, there is our ""Joy Lobo"" from '3 Idiots' playing an Abu- Dhabi guy. :PThere are just too many characters doing little jobs rather than less number of characters doing big jobs.So finally, we come to the primary reason which urges you to watch the movie, and precisely the reason why it is doing such good business. It is the ending, which pays a very fine tribute to our beloved Paul Walker weaving the story-line into an emotional ride, which leaves you gasping and with soggy eyes.People who feel an attachment towards this series and towards the actors pertaining to the series, should watch it for the final homage to Paul Walker. As they say - One Last Ride.Worth one watch. 2.5/5"
5,"If you're seeing this movie because you think Paul Walker will know somehow, you're wrong. Also, his family's probably pretty well off, with the 25 million dollar estate that was handed down upon his death to his daughter.Just because you saw him on a screen, doesn't mean you're family. Use reason. Respect the living; simply remember the dead. It is not necessary for everyone to know how sad an actor's death makes you. You don't have to be the most mournful. You don't have to be mournful at all, if you didn't know him, or the family.He's been dead for close to a year and a half, by the by, so this ain't ""too soon"". People already forgot about Robin Williams.I never met Paul, and so I'll review the movie as a movie.The action sequences in this film are mostly good. Fight choreography, also pretty good. It's all meant to be over-the-top, and while they take great liberties with physics, it's fun to watch.The ""story"" and ""acting"" sequences in-between the action are awful, often ridiculous, especially near the end, when, at one point, they eschew medical procedures for a friggin' story - and that works, somehow.You may not have seen this many clichés and catch-phrases in another movie, so that's something they might have achieved. Not good clichés, mind you, just borrowed ones from every other action movie you've ever seen.So many ""nick-of-time"" sequences were included, it's hard to stay on the edge of your seat for the whole movie, and eventually, everything becomes somewhat too ""extreme"", and subsequently deflated.The tribute to Paul Walker at the end was very tasteful, well done, but that isn't going to gain it anything in the ""movie quality"" department.The movie itself is not much of a tribute to anyone, and will quickly be forgotten by this viewer.The 5/10 is for the work the guys behind the scenes did to make this thing worth watching in some way; the digital guys, the choreographers, the coaches, etc.The end sets everything up for ""FF:InfuriEight"" (suggested title).Theater:No; Buy:No; Rent:Yes, Free:Yes."
5,"As it's already said, tribute to Paul Walker is great! But, that does not mean that just because this is his last film deserves to get high scores.I couldn't enjoy the movie, because i knew how every scene will end. Another thing i hate about last few F&F movies is the fact that races are totally ignored and all over, story turns to action and fights that are unrealistic like WWE and destroys all the pleasure of watching as it was case with first three movies.Tyrese Gibson is the reason I enjoyed the most during screening, and how it seems and the rest of the audience as well ... His jokes were the funniest.However, it remains to me, a little faith that it will be yet somewhat corrected in the eighth part."
5,"I was eagerly waiting for this movie!Actually this movie was one of my most awaited movie of the year besides .. Mi-5 , 007 and Avengers-2.Anyways i was very disappointed with this movie.Let me tell you the reasons :-It felt like Furious 7 was a superhero movie .. Jason Statham was a super-villain, And Vin-Diesel was SUPERMAN.No matter how hard they hit each other THEY won't DIE.Even Car crashes Can't kill them!! Way TOO many actors,With ZERO character development of Jason Statham!! LAME super-villain The story is very weak...Felt it was just written for STUNTS. You will see Vin diesel & his MUMBLING most of the time... Actors like Dwayne Johnson , Tony Jaa , Djimon Hounsou and LUCAS BLACK are totally wasted here! Stunts/Actions are so UN-believably over the top that it even beats Tamil/Telegu movie stunts/action!The connections between the old films and the new films have previously been well thought out and well written ahead of time. In ""Furious 7,"" they just make stuff up, and attempts to extend the franchise somehow..""Furious 7"" doesn't really work. The ""Fast & Furious"" franchise has always been silly, but for the first time in its 14-year history, it's really dumb.And the WEAKEST film of Fast & Furious FRANCHISE.The franchise has clearly become Vin Diesel & UNIVERSAL's CASH COW.The only thing i liked in this movie was PAUL WALKERS TRIBUTE..My ADVICE : Don't waste your hard-earned money .. wait for HDRip/DVDRip/Blu-ray."
5,"I went to see the movies as the 6th part was awesome and i regretted seeing it later. The promo was awesome , Rock had a 10 min appearance, you keep expecting him to come until the end. secondly dom was shown way too powerful, his is throwing jason as if he was a doll. Letty's fighting skills were immensely improved and flying car was a bit too much. last part was way much better. The best thing about the movie was that you can't differentiate between original and digitally created paul walker. Dwayane was awesome in whatever small part he got, wish he had a larger role.Ludicrous and the other guy were wasted. Ronda and that on bak hero was not given the right role. The movie was a One man show and that man suc*** big time."
5,"For those whom may be familiar but have not seen any of the Fast and Furious franchise, I strongly recommend you do not start with this film because it will almost definitely turn you off from what are a great few films. I've generously given this film a 5 star rating only for the decently exciting action sequences and the few actors and actresses that continued to portray their characters well. As for the rest, what happened? This film is about the older brother of Owen Shaw, that the FF team took on in the previous film, wanting revenge for the harm done to his brother. This new antagonists name is Deckard Shaw, the last film's ending reveals that the accident that killed Han, A FF team member, in the third FF movie was actually cause by Deckard Shaw. This movie pretty much starts from there and revolves around the battle between Shaw and the FF team.Now I've seen all the actors and actresses in this film act very well in other films, so I tend to blame the poor acting on the director and script. Dominic is nothing like the character he once was, he's a completely stiff meat head that speaks nothing but cliché sentences. It's like the screen writer typed ""Bad*** one liners"", into Google and tried to find a way to fit every one of them in the script. I haven't seen Vin Diesel ever play such a paper thin, boring, predictable character other than Riddick, only in Vin's self produced horrible sequel to the first 2 films. (Pitch Black and The Chronicles were actually good flicks.) I could go on and on but to sum it up its a classic Hollywood case of, more boom(Explosions) and less substance. It's a disease that plagues some of the best franchises and struck this one right around its 4th movie, though only a slight case in that film, so it was still enjoyable.Keep this in mind, I'm a fan of this franchise and of what its about. If anything my opinion should be biased in favor of this movie, but its really just that bad.Lastly I'd personally like to say I'd like to see more of Sean Boswell in the up coming films. The first Fast and the Furious and Tokyo Drift are my favorite in the franchise. And after Sean's mentor(Han) was killed, his character only seeing 2 minutes of screen time in this film was a complete joke. Furthermore, so was the scene that explained Dom beat Sean in a drift race. Sean was DRIFT KING, Dom was in an old heavy muscle car and we have seen no experience with him in any actual drift races. This scene is synonymous for the entire film. Defy absolutely every piece of logic and realism to make Dominic Toretto look like the most bad*** man whom ever lived. Had they worked less hard on that maybe they would have made a decent film.R.I.P. Walker"
5,"I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don't buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta ""standup"" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it's just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn't make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.
Is this a movie I would watch again? Probably not."
5,"Phoenix is great. The cinematography as well. That's it.The world described in the film is not realistic, despite what they try to *tell* you. They don't show, they never show. Everything that happens is finalized to sustain Fleck's downfall. It's not organic, it feels forced. A lot of ideas, none of them explored sufficiently.The movie is basically an amalgamation of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Too many scenes that were ""inspired"" by those two great masterpieces, that deal with these matters in an actual thoughtful and mature way.
This truly is the ""we live in a society"" film.I wanted to like it, I really did. I couldn't. I'm sorry? Go cry in the corner, if you're offended by my opinion."
5,"Brilliant acting for this film, found myself I was waiting for something to happen, get the message about mental health and how bad the system is, but something missing for me"
5,"It's funny to see so many 10's, this Joker is not the Batman's Joker, but someone who inspired the criminal who will become the Batman's Joker.
This movie is more a drama and a portrait of today's society than a Super Heroes (Villain) movie... so, don't expect action.
The performance is good, but not superb. I think the movie is very overrated."
5,"""Joker"" is highly derivative and a poor imitation of better Scorsese movies. The movie didn't really know what it was trying to say. On top of that it's very cynical and will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Great performance from Joaquin Phoenix but it's not essential viewing."
5,"The positives, Phoenix, the cinematography. Negatives, the screenplay, the pacing, the incredibly lackluster walk on performance by DeNiro who when not being directed by Scorsese shows up to collect a paycheck. This movie was less entertaining than a documentary on psychosis."
5,"Joker didnt have any of the clever banter that we have come to know and love from one of the most well known Villians in history. The pace of this movie was totally off and basically a snooze fest for the first 40 minutes. Joaquin plays a great crazy person, but this origin story doesent give him enough leeway to truly do this movie justice. Some of the mannerisms were spot on, but the demeanor and intelligence level if the villain himself totally capsized any Hope's of enjoying this. The killings were bland and did not bring any desperately needed artistic element to the film. Towards the end, the connection made between the death of one and the rebirth of another was probably the smartest scene, and simply not worth waiting until the end to see. I left the theater in total confusion and dissappointment."
5,"Cinematography, costume design and one powerhouse performance do not a good movie make. In truth, Joker is poorly paced with a lackluster story that Frankenstiens together elements from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It borrows so liberally I'm amazed it didn't get hit with a plagiarism lawsuit.Additionally, the movie has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It's sociological commentary is ham-fisted and bland, and it lacks any truly jaw-dropping moments. Outside of the Talk Show scene and a single shot near the end, it's all very forgettable.And the song for the stair dance sequence was so colossally stupid it completely pulled me out of the film.That being said, Joaquin was great and the aforementioned cinematography and costume design were very solid. All in all, the movie coasts on Phoenix's mesmerizing portrayal, but never goes far enough to really get under your skin. Biggest letdown of the year."
5,"Yes, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful job in his portrayal of the Joker. Albeit this Joker is plain and simple just mentally ill. He is generally portrayed in previous genres as a criminal genius mastermind. A person with wit, and masterful comprehension of trickery, and chemicals.This Joker is no fun, and highly delusional. You may question his intellect as he has to look up simple jokes in a diary he keeps. Yes, for the most part his jokes fall flat. Jack Nicholson' clever portrayal in Batman raised the bar that in my opinion has never quite been reached.I found myself uncomfortable with this portrayal as you would with someone acting out next to you on a subway. In that respect, Joaquin portrays this bit of brazen craziness to a tee. Craziness for the sake of craziness does not make for entertainment. If a sane person were locked up in a mental institution, you would not be entertained. And that is a bit how this movie felt."
5,"Let me start with my summary.. ""Mehhh"".Why on earth this movie had to be in the DC universe I have no idea. A criminal mastermind Joaquin Phoenix's joker will never be. As a social commentary on mental illness it might have worked. But this guy is not the joker, nor is there anyway he could become the joker. He is just too sad of a character.The tacked on violence at the end seemed like something put there as a crowd pleaser for all the people that was expecting something related to Batman. Ohh naturally they had to put in the killing of Batmans parents. I mean that way we know it has something to do with the joker right?We were three guys in our mid thirties and we were all thoroughly bored. Well acted but not interesting."
5,"Its depressing and it doesn't give any good message to the people , somehow its gives the face of our society cruelty and the truth ."
5,"I really have no idea why this film gets this kind of hype and rating. Coming in I was excited to see what was all the hype about but I left in despair and asking myself what's wrong with me for not liking this movie? Has it become a norm that everything that feels a little different automatically means we have an oscar on our hands? JP definitely deserves all the praise he's getting but I can't shake the feeling that it was all tried too hard to make it look way too serious and different while the plot didn't at all get the same treatment. I'm sorry, but this film doesn't live up to its expectations, it really doesn't."
5,"I've seen the word ""masterpiece"" attached to many, many reviews, so much so that I can't help but wonder if there's a coordinated effort. If so, this review is not part of that effort.Let's get into it - Joaquin Phoenix does a really good job in this role, especially when in his Joker costume - there were times when he seemed to be channeling Heath Ledger. Although, I have to confess that without his Joker makeup, his face reminded me of Ty Burrell, who plays Phil Dunphy on Modern Family - they really look similar to me. And since Phil Dunphy is such a harmless character, it sort of took me out of the moment. Regardless, Joaquin did a great job.Now, the story? Well, that was a little less impressive to me. I've heard people say that the Joker was an unreliable narrator, which is true, but I don't know if that necessarily makes this a better movie. I think the movie is definitely a showcase of a character with mental illness, which makes me think of Heath Ledger's line: ""Why so serious?""Also, I learned afterward that this movie is disconnected from the overall D.C. cinematic universe, which I find odd. I mean, it's a fairly decent portrayal of the Joker, so why put it in its own little bubble universe? To my mind, that basically makes this movie a glorified fan fiction, and again, begs the question, ""why?""Anyway, I think the movie is worth seeing, as much of it is well done. However, it's not one that I feel any urge to rewatch. My two cents."
5,"I wonder why DC licensed the brand to Todd n Co. The character (Arthur Fleck) never creates any chaos by himself, no manipulation n threat stuff, no explosions, no gunpowders. In short, there's very little this Joker does other than just borrowing the costume and signature laugh from the iconic character. Of course one could argue that it's a character in it's early stages before transforming into the supervillain. But then what's the fun in watching just another psychopath movie with a troubled psychotic patient getting bullied and disregarded by society. Honestly, I've seen a ton of movies with a similar plot. To make matter worse, the character doesn't even turn a villain at the end of the movie. JOKER is a mediocre attempt psychotic thriller movie which doesn't do justice to the title. The movie could've worked better as an independent film without the unnecessary portrayal of the legendary character."
5,"Joaquin Phoenix' performance: ARest of the movie as a whole: DTotal: CSome will love it, some will hate it. I'm somewhere in the middle."
5,"Masterpiece? No.
Great? No.
Good? Barely.Sure the acting was good, but it was overshadowed by the drudgery. I kept saying to myself, ""get to the point"". Does the director think I'm stupid? I get it, he is insane. But they forgot that not only is the Joker insane, he is freaking brilliant.How can it be a masterpiece if the movie misses the centerpiece??Finally, the movie is way too long and plods along so slowly repeating the same note without creating a symphony.Hopefully the fan edit will dwindle this down to it's essence while providing some depth. At almost 2 hours, the movie creates an atmosphere of overindulgence of self-aggrandizing without substance.One last point, the the sheer amount of 10 rated reviews prior to this movie's release is indicative of the shenanigans of the movie industry and reflective of American business. Just shameful."
5,"The acting was spot on, Phoenix did a great job, but the direction was weak and meandering, wasting precious time to ineffectively build tension, dragging out weak points and confusing the storyline at times, This movie could have been more intense with much better direction and editing out about 30+ minutes of filler that had the movie's storyline treading water for way too long. Their use of foreboding soundtracks and then nothing happening was also annoying. Stretching the movie out like the director did, really created a slow roll to the climax which everyone saw coming about an hour before it happened. By the time it arrived it was an anticlimax, slow boring movie with strong acting performances and really poor direction. Don't fall for the hype, it just doesn't live up to it in any way. Disappointed..."
5,"It wasn't a masterpiece. It wasn't even a great movie. It wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't what it claimed to be. It wasn't a comic book movie. It wasn't even a Joker movie. Except for a few shoe horned references to Batman lore it was just Falling Down with a little Fight Club and liberal amounts of Taxi Driver.The character of Arthur, though well acted, was too pathetic to be any incarnation of the iconic villain. He had no charisma or cleverness. His 'condition' of laughing inappropriately more often than not sounded like sobbing and when he should have been laughing, he didn't. When he smothered his mother, maniacal laughter would have been appropriate.The film fell victim to the same folly some recent horror remakes have. Child abuse creates monsters. Sometimes. We don't need to create sympathy for Michael Meyers or Joker. Psychopathy is scarier when you can't understand its root. Some people are just bad.The Joker is not a tragic villain and to portray him as such is the first indication that this movie was a marketing gimmick. Slap the name of a character with an established fan base on a pretty unoriginal story and make a billion dollars. Good job Warner Brothers. If this is the formula for the DCEU going forward, I see why there are so many rumors about closing down comic book production. Wouldn't want fans comparing the movies to the comics, now."
5,"Acting of mr.Phoenix was good. But the movie had no story.
No story
Nothing from comics
Bipolar disorder can't really lead to become boss.of Gotham underground.
Very boring"
5,The acting by JP is phenomenal but the disappointment from the movie is that that's the only thing to watch. Now you can understand that even Heath Ledger needed a Nolan and a Zimmer and Howard combo to make it legendary.
5,"In my opinion this movie is too disturbed.
The character of ""Joker"" is a sick person that loves to kill other people but that's not who Joker should be.
So in general, there are good parts in the movie but in total I'm disappointed by it!"
5,"Based on the existing reviews I doubt many will agree but I wouldn't waste the money to see this. If I could rate this movie in multiple ways I think it'd be more helpful, and I think that's the inherent issue. Everyone is praising Phoenix for playing his ""Masterpiece"" of a role, and yes, he did a great job, but the movie as a whole sucked in my opinion. Especially considering it doesn't even fit in with the DC timeline and therefore the whole movie just doesn't make sense from that aspect."
5,"Move is slow. It's mainly about mental illness. Not The Joker. And I don't wanna hear Phoenix even holds a candle to Ledgers Joker. It's not close. Ledger is a legend and Phoenix is something to forget. For one, he is a soft, weak, milquetoast man (his character). It is surrounded by darkness but not the kind you like or can enjoy. It's a sad & dreary played out movie that takes too long like someone that speaks a lot but doesn't say much. He isn't the Joker till roughly 20-25 minutes left. To sum it up, he smokes a cigarette, dances in a twirl, gets humiliated and laughs while crying for 3/4 of the movie. Spare me. It wasn't very good and is definitely overhyped. But I'm glad De Niro got his head blown off."
5,"As a big Joker fan who has been waiting for this movie, the whole year. I left the theatre underwhelmed and frankly a bit bored. I really hope I will like it more with a second viewing because I love the Joker as a character. Joaquin Phoenix is unbelivably good as he is in all his movies and the cinematography is breathtaking but I just didn't feel the story. I expect this movie to be divisive once the initial excitement is gone."
5,"I was super excited when I saw the trailer. I was expecting a plot that would blow my mind, but absolutely disappointed with the storyline. The good part of the movie is the actor himself. Joaquin Phoenix really pulled off this intense character. Oscar for Phoenix!Just a perfect storyline was missing, otherwise it would be a jaw-dropping movie."
5,"Knowing the full history of the event, this movie is more about American pride and heroism than cars. As an huge racing fan and a Formula 1 fan whom enjoyed the original Grand Prix and Rush, this movie does not hit the spot, rather childish."
5,"It's not a bad movie, but it's quite flat and nothing that you haven't seen before. Lacks in epic qualities and in depicting the true dangers of racing in those days. Forgettable soundtrack. See ""Rush"" for a far better outcome on all these aspects. The worst flaw is in the way they filmed the circuit De La Sarthe: first, there's no iconic shot on the Mulsanne straight, that's something I don't understand; secondly, they failed in showing what a grind was driving at 300kmh for three minutes, with a couple of very hard brakes. Also, they didn't show the slower classes of cars racing simultaneously, that were a true hazard. Overall, little remains for racing enthusiasts."
5,"This is as simple as a kids Movie and the stereotype characters and simple-minded dialogues made me laugh. Womens (beside Ms. Miles) are completely missing. A lot of scenes are ungainly constructet (wheel nut, stopwatch, ...) or just boring. And why the hell Mr. Miles carries everywhere in the world everytime the same coffee pot? And beside all this to me the race scenes weren't really thrilling."
5,"Maybe it's because we know the race result, so the suspense isnt really there. Some good cinematography but the race sequences are so repetitive."
5,"Blech, did Ron Howard direct this thing, or is James Mangold just trying to trick us into thinking he did?Look, I'm not at all into cars or car racing, so maybe I'm not the target audience for this. But I'm also not into diamonds or the diamond business, and I thought ""Uncut Gems"" was one of the best films of the year. I don't have to be ""into"" a subject in order to enjoy a movie about it, if the movie is done well.""Ford v Ferrari"" is the kind of dull, bland movie made to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, which....guess what?.....it was. The world is full of urgent problems, so what's the last thing we need? A bro movie about a car race from 50 years ago. But if you're going to make one, try to make one more memorable than this. This is the kind of movie that makes whenever it's set look like a glossy magazine version of that particular time period. It's the kind of movie that has one woman in it, in this case The Wife, who the screenplay assures us belongs in this world of boring white men because she knows a lot about cars and can be sexually suggestive when talking about them. It's the kind of movie that lets us know who the chief rival in the big final race is by cutting to shots of him glowering at the screen literally every 15 seconds. It's full of a certain American attitude I simply can't stand, exemplified by the fact that it has to make all of the Europeans in the movie look like bungling fools. I'm not sure what the movie's point is. I think it means to set up a conflict between those men who built and raced cars because of their passion for the art of it and those who just wanted to make a buck off of it. So of course this message is packaged in the safest, shiniest, most corporate Hollywood product imaginable.Matt Damon's good ol' boy accent is unacceptable. Christian Bale is too good to be in this movie. Noah Jupe is a cute kid but he's used as a cheap narrative tactic to make us even more worried about the race scenes because we don't want to have to watch a little boy watch his dad go up in flames in real time. The best moment in the movie belongs to Tracey Letts.Grade: C"
5,"Had a personal day yesterday and picked out a movie I figured my girlfriend didn't want to see (and boy was I right, for multiple reasons).Bale phones in his performance with a subpar Cockney accent that doesn't fool ANYONE, the script is predictable and the dialogue is flat and boring and makes you cringe so many times you start fearing for your health.I was close to leaving the theater at multiple occasions, and I was never as close as during the ""fight"" scene outside Bale's house. At that point, one thinks someone in the crew should've had the integrity to raise his or her voice and say they should just go ahead and scrap the whole thing. Cut their losses.It felt like a two hour and thirty minute Disney Channel-straight-to-DVD movie that could've easily been compressed to 60 minutes.The only demographics I see enjoying this are kids, and male car buffs in their 60s that still daydream about winning ""that"" race and riding down into the sunset with that girl from high school they were too scared to speak to speak to 45 years ago.For Bale, whose been on a roll in decent years, this movie is blemish of the worst kind. Sucks."
5,"Typically if you show me a decent trailer involving actors of the calibre of Matt Damon and Christian Bale, I will be at least interested in seeing more. Couple that with a film that appeared to stay faithful to racing's core principles and sparsely use CGI for stunts, I was then invested in seeing where this depiction of Le Mans '66 would end up going. My doubts, regretfully, were reinforced roughly halfway through the film: the plot had devolved, the characters inconsequential, and the on-screen action boiled down to a clunky contest between the ""God-driven, hard-working"" Ford company and their lazily-stereotyped adversaries at Ferrari.Carroll Shelby (Damon), an ex-racer now mechanic/expert on the national circuit is recruited by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to begin work on a racing outfit under the name of Ford. Interestingly, Bernthal (a highly regarded actor in his own right) was painted in the trailers as a key figure in this film - however, he is marginalised almost instantly, making the final product appear recut since shooting finished. Shelby recommends the British driver Ken Miles (Bale), a notoriously difficult but brilliant driver to race under Ford at Le Mans. However, a comically minor incident between Miles and Chief Exec Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) begins the most out-of-proportion grudge between the two, constantly trying to screw the company over for absolutely no founded reason other than they rubbed the wrong way.This is the plot for the next 2 hours, interspersed with ugly stereotypes of either the English (through Miles and his family) or the Italians (portrayed as evil, scheming foreigners working under Enzo Ferrari's orders). This further ruins the realism of the entire film - am I really supposed to believe that the conglomerate that is Ford Motors is really the altruist in a story about the authenticity of racing? Further to this - isn't it beyond indolent to completely omit Miles' driving partners (Bruce McLaren and Denny Hulme) in a film about a race requiring two drivers throughout? The narrative constantly eludes that ""only Ken Miles is good enough to drive this race"", and yet he is constantly partnered with someone who must have been as good to maintain their success.The driving is almost secondary to the glaring errors throughout the film, but it does provide some relief from the cringeworthy American narrative. The cars do look authentic and rough; the clothing matches the era, and the design of the film on the most part is clean and period-accurate. This shouldn't really come as a surprise given the profile and budget of the film, and almost makes the real issue (something I wasn't focussed on but that my father did point out) even more glaring: the driving makes no sense. Miles will be ""visualising"" his perfect lap, smooth changes and steady racing, and then come race-day, will slam the gears in and yank the steering wheel round corners like nobody in an endurance race ever would. This, to me, is a killer to a film reliant on accuracy - you cannot expect the audience to respect your work if you yourselves cannot stay faithful to the source material.I wanted to like this film. I am still waiting for a film based on cars or planes to really blow me away. Dunkirk mad me sure that this sort of cinema can be done well, but they need both a director who breathes the topic, as well as a production company willing to take the financial risk to fully commit to creating this sort of feature."
5,"Efficient and well made... and that's it. A simple and straight story with another ""American Hero"" (maybe a couple of heros) and a lot of simplistic and a bit silly stereotypes. A bit childishly from my point of view, but ok if you are looking for a simple and easy to understand pic."
5,"I don't what to say - it just wasn't for me. If you're not into racing or cars or the ""american dream"" I think this is probably a movie to miss. For me, it was already not my style, but on top of that it felt like a film that had recycled the plot and characters of every other sports movie and re-skinned it.Both Bale and Damon's accents were laid on thicker than ""fur on a frog"". Did I do that right? Apart from that - the performances were likely the highlight in the otherwise underwhelming film.Another issue is that at least in other sports films there's a clearer, unifying theme to the movie. This film felt confused at times. Was Ford's bureaucracy a detriment or a strength? It flipped on a dime between what seemed like demonizing and congratulating Ford. Was it about friendship? That theme did not seem apart until its final scene - leaving it as a last ditch effort to move and connect the audience to the characters. At the very least we could say it celebrated Ken Miles for his achievements in the racing world - so kudos to that."
5,Petrol heads will probably enjoy this and the racing scenes are well done but there was nothing that really gripped me about this movie. The two central characters were pretty good but the film could use at least 20 minutes of trimming. Not bad abut also not great
5,"Well, now I know that the way to succeed in racing is get by your rival and give him a dirty look. Great acting and this movie looks fantastic, let down by the script. And anyone who thinks Ferrari was the ""underdog"" really didn't follow racing in the 60s. Yeah, Ford outspent Ferrari, but money doesn't equal wins, or Ferrari would dominate F1 today."
5,"I wont dinied ford v ferrari has quality in it which is hard not to have when mangold is director and damon and bale stars and it will be great watch for some,but to me it wasnt,i was never fan of cars and racing so i coudnt invest myself in story and at some points it became for me boring and to long,ford v ferrari will probably win some awards and for that i say it deserves,but at the end i myself would rather watch something else"
5,"Surprisingly funny and well acted racing movie. Racing scenes are well done, acting is superb especially by Christian Bale. But other than that, it's long and it feels. I can't say it's spectacular or anything eihter."
5,"Imagine making a movie called Ford v Ferrari, and giving Ferrari driver Bandini just a constant evil grin, no lines. Not one. Making Ferrari boss Enzo an a-hole. He uses translator, but when it comes to insulting he becomes Hamlet. As for the Le Mans 66', the racing scenes are weak. Miles behind Bandini, he passes him. And he is still one lap behind. The gap is 8,5 miles now. Then boom! He is right behind him again on the very next scene. And this is a 2 and a half hour movie by the way. Some other scenes are ridiculous. Leo Beebe calls a guy on pit and makes him show the sign EZ to slow Miles. He makes million more terrible things like that. Better call the movie Ford vs Leo Beebe. Only good thing about this movie is acting by Bale, as expected. Other than that, it is just another big Hollywood production to make big money by stupifying everything in the story (1917 does the same), because the Hollywood formula demands it. Dumb movies make money. What a time to be alive..."
5,"It´s a film without emotion. Well filmed and with some of the best actors in the world, it practically transmits nothing. Love for cars, calling cars as if they were women, being moved by engine revolutions, have nothing to do with the current times of silent, electric and non-polluting cars. But above all they do not transmit anything, family situations, servility towards bosses, nor, how did he say any emotion."
5,"I read a review of this film in the New Yorker that said the title was unfortunate because it would make people think it was a sports film when it was more than that. The reviewer was wrong. This is a sports movie, with all the sports movie tropes, and it's all been done better.The film follows car designers Carrol Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles as they work to help Ford create a car that can beat Ferrari's in a big race. This in itself is odd, in that the movie wants you to see the guys working for a corporate behemoth as scrappy underdogs, which is a bit of a stretch.This is very much a boy movie, by which I mean it's entirely focused on testosterone-fueled competition ranging from international pissing contests to corporate competition to fist fights on the lawn. You could easily call this movie ""Mine is Bigger."" And much of my problem with the movie was I didn't care whose was bigger.The best thing in the movie is Bale as Miles. Instead of the typical cocky race driver of other films, Miles comes across as grease-monkey engineer who not only engineers the car but also plans and engineers his entire race. It's a smart, amiable performance that should be in a better movie.I am perplexed that this movie was nominated for an Oscar against genuinely significant movies like Parasite and Jojo Rabbit. The best I can say of it is that it is less undeserving of the nomination than Joker. I'm also puzzled by all the gushing reviews.There are some good moments, particularly in the racing scenes, but the film is hugely overlong and everything past the end of the race feels like a needless and maudlin dragging out of something that should have been a zippy 90-minute film.Not recommended."
5,"Review: As I'm not a massive racing car fan, I wasn't over-excited about this movie, but the cast was impressive and the story was intriguing. The director portrayed the 60's period well, and the cars were amazing, but the whole racing car theme became a bit tedious after a while. All of the technical jargon went straight over my head, but the attention to detail, in terms of the cars and the tracks, was on point. The acting from Christian Bale (Ken Miles) and Matt Damon (Carroll Shelby) seemed average in my eyes, mainly because I didn't know the real-life characters that they were portraying, so I didn't know how accurate it was. With that aside, the chemistry between the characters was great, and there were some scenes, which didn't have anything to do with racing, which was enjoyable, but the main core of the movie seemed a bit too safe to me. There weren't any standout moments that stood out, and I wasn't left feeling that I wanted to find out more about the characters. I know that the' race is an important part of American history that will always be remembered, but I personally lost interest once Carroll and Ken joined forces. I did feel the intensity during the races, which made me stick with the two and a half hour movie, and I did find the ending quite shocking, but it's not the type of movie that I will be watching again. That's not to say that it's a bad film because it does exactly what it says on the tin, but it's just not my cup of tea. Average!Round-Up: This movie was directed by James Mangold, who also brought you Heavy in 1995, Copland, Girl Interrupted, Kate & Leopold, Identity, Walk The Line, 3:10 to Yuma, Knight & Day, The Wolverine and Logan. He's due to direct 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: Captain Nemo and the new Indiana Jones project, but with the Coronavirus in our midst, no one really knows what's going to happen to the upcoming projects that are in pre-production. Judging by his filmography, he has made some impressive movies to date, and with this movie going down well with critics worldwide, the only way is up for this established director. The only reason why I wasn't that impressed with this film was because of the subject matter, but it's well made and the box office takings prove that it was enjoyed by many.Budget: $97.6million Worldwide Gross: $225.5millionGenre: Action, Biography, Drama, Sport Cast: Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Tracy Letts, Remo Girone, Ray McKinnon, JJ Feild and Jack McMullen. 5/10"
5,"I'm an hour in and all I can think is why this is up for oscars. Nothing stands out at all and it's a little dull. It's all been done before. Watch cool runnings, Eddie the eagle. It just didn't draw me in. No real stand out performances from what I can see and a story which is liberal with the truth.I'll say it again. Oscar nominated? I think the oscar panel got a lot of free gifts from the studio.Watch Senna instead. Me or my partner are not racing fans but both loved that."
5,"The movie follows the 90s sportsmovie structure to a tee.It's been a week since i saw the movie and I am already starting to confuse scenes in from the movie with scenes from 2006s 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby', in my head.Josh Lucas hamming it up as the movies corny antagonist - helps to blur the lines further.The movie sounds great and looks beautiful - but if you are looking for anything beyond that, this one might not be for you."
5,"An unnecessarily long, average movie with Christian Bale! and looks like ""Ford v Ken Miles"" would be a much better title."
5,Another film where there's clearly been a sophisticated marketing background. I was looking forward to this but it was mediocre. There are some good moments but it's about 45mins too long. The best bits are the driving. Christian Bale used to be an interesting actor. Damon does his best to make a film but it's not enough. Can I get my money back?
5,"Movie is super primitive, cliche driven and as unoriginal as it gets. it totally holds on actors performances! script is brain dead. they did succeed with tear jerking goal, but boy everything else feels so artificial. re-watch it and you will come to the same understanding. cheesy dialog , poor camera, poor script."
5,"I am a big Gar..... sorry Christian Bale fan but really overacts in this paint by numbers predictable nonsense full of pantomime characters and ridiculous dialogue. In its favour, Matt Damon good, production values good....That's about it!!"
5,"Christian Bale was useless at playing a Englishman - Americans just can't do English accents - they must have all gone to the Dick Van Dyke acting school!!
Why did they not cast an English actor to play the part of a Englishman? Despite this the film held together well and was very enjoyable."
6,"I rarely write reviews but i feel this one deserves one that isn't one of the overwhelmingly clouded reviews, that mix real world tragedy into the rating of a fictional piece of work.The movie is entertaining for everyone that knows what to expect and the ridiculousness of the action scenes is fun in itself. Other than that, this movie is far away from the masterpiece a lot of people make it out to be. Especially the serious parts of the dialogue are a 101 on clichéd movie lines and the story is as surprising as the content of a bag of chips. Paul Walker was a decent actor and his death is mourned by many but an emotional 5 minute tribute at the end of the movie, that also seems tacked on in terms of the storyline, is swaying many into thinking they witnessed a new Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather movie.If you are a fan of the series you're in for a great ride and if you're into action movies in general you won't waste your time with this one. Just keep an honest perspective about this movies place in history."
6,"I think a lot of the reviewers are giving this movie high scores because of the whole 'it was Paul Walker's last' thing. The tribute to him was, in my view, perfect and I think it was executed really well. Full marks on that. But let's be real about the actual movie. You have to suspend belief from 5 minutes and keep it suspended until the tribute starts. These movies have always had a level of bang and stunts that was unrealistic, and there is A LOT of that in this movie, but even the plot itself is ridiculous. How many innocent third parties are allowed to be killed and or have their property damage so a bunch of street racers can try to settle a score with a guy so highly trained, a TEAM of special forces guys couldn't take him down after the government decided he was more of a liability than an asset (so we are told). Seems like a legit premise...If you are after a bit of fun and action then this movie is just fine. I didn't not enjoy it. But the plot is so ridiculously unrealistic that for me, it made for a disappointing end to the franchise. As I said in the title, the beautiful Paul Walker tribute can't undo the silly of this movie. I think I will just cut Tokyo Drift out of my collection so I can pretend Han never died and movie 7 never needed to happen."
6,"Positive(+): Late Paul gave the film a massive opening, tribute to the powerful character of FF Series. The team really worked hard to make sure that Brian O'Conner (Paul) was there in complete film from the start to end. I was concentrating each and every step of Paul to know how the director had taken the plot to give him a final send-off. It was beautifully executed way beyond the expectation level. Good work the whole team to make it happen.Negative(-): No street race, illogical at many aspects, Dwayne Johnson short screen presence had made the movie stretching into a boring plot! Jason Statham screen presence is like a magic.He will be everywhere without any clue of how he got into the place!Overall - An average movie"
6,"After ""Fast & Furious 6"" shifted the action of this mega-series into a gear not known to man — one resembling a superhero movie far more than an action franchise — those following the ""Fast & Furious"" had to either get on board or jump out. So the mantra for enjoying ""Furious 7"" is ""embrace the insanity."" You either get a kick out of it or you don't.For all the crazy stuff they pulled in 6, there's an equal or one-up in 7. In the last movie you had the crew trying to take down a massive cargo plane; in this movie you have cars skydiving out of a massive cargo plane. Even when you can guess something insane is coming, you still can't believe what the filmmakers decided to do. For example, a sequence in Abu Dhabi involves the crew needing to steal something locked inside of a rare and exotic car locked in a safe room at the top of one of the city's biggest buildings. Need I say more?The plot holds a little less water than 6, and to say that any ""F&F"" plot holds any more or less water than another is a big difference. The film is put in motion by the events of 6, as that film's baddie, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), is in a coma, and his special ops older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wants revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and company. Plausible, except that Deckard has an uncanny ability to track people down, show up in the right place at the right time, sneak into government facilities, perfectly time explosives and stay one step ahead of everyone — all by himself.OK, easy enough to embrace that insanity. But after Dominic decides to go after Shaw, a mysterious suit and tie named Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) shows up with a small army to save the day and offer Dominic all his resources to track Shaw down if he and his crew can rescue a hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a band of mercenaries led by Mose Jakande (Djimon Honsou) and find a device she invented called the God's Eye that turns all devices into the world into a personal surveillance system that can track anyone  All this to justify sending Dom, O'Conner (Paul Walker), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris Bridges) to the Caucasus Mountains, Abu Dhabi and beyond. It's not longtime series writer Chris Morgan's finest work.With the ""we don't care about physics"" cat out of the bag, the sky is literally the limit for what these characters can do or endure. The highs of the movie come from this potential for unbelievably imaginative sequences, but so many scenes lose suspense because we know that our heroes can fall, roll over and get crushed countless times and emerge virtually unscathed. In fact, it's kind of ridiculous that Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) actually ends up in the hospital after a ""nearly fatal"" fall early in the movie. The film's most suspenseful moment involves O'Conner, but perhaps because Walker's untimely death during production had audiences in suspense over how his character would bow out.Walker's unfinished work is hard to detect. A few scenes seem out of place in an effort to use actual footage of Walker whenever possible, but if you had no idea he died during production, you'd be taken by surprise by the film's tribute ending. It really only provides us emotional catharsis for losing Paul Walker, not for the departure of Brian O'Conner from these stories. His character arc just doesn't feel complete, but undoubtedly there was only so much the filmmakers could do.Horror aficionado James Wan, taking over for four-time ""F&F"" director Justin Lin, brings a lot of Lin's style and adds a signature in various 90-degree camera rotations that usually follow characters in action sequences when they are not standing upright and usually in the air or falling. In a way, these shots acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the action scenes.""Furious 7"" probably takes itself the least seriously of all the movies thus far, and in that sense, it makes all the ridiculousness easier to stomach. Gibson's Pierce is really forced into the jokester role, and he manages a few laughs that he wasn't getting (from this critic) in previous films when he was prematurely being shoehorned into that stereotype. And Hobbs' return after being out of the middle act of the movie is perhaps the biggest signal that we're all supposed to just be having fun together.These movies haven't quite done enough to reach a higher echelon of quality given the relaxed attitude toward good storytelling, but it's clear to anyone that they are not trying to meet any needs beyond a fun time. Hence, each movie grades out pretty similarly, with a little variation here and there. If we weren't familiar with and invested in the characters and if the budget for these movies weren't so astronomical that we could have fun watching them just because they have the money to show off, the litany of flaws would be more apparent. The high entertainment value and lack of substance pretty much offset each other, resulting in movies that are immensely watchable yet only so satisfying.~Steven CThanks for reading!

6,"An Easter weekend cinema-going of this topical car-chasing no brainer, a franchise has already exceedingly overstayed its shelf-life, reaches an unforeseen acme catalysed by the tragic loss of its co-leading man Paul Walker last year (ironically in a car crash, again a bloody testimony of ""movies are deceitful"", considering in this latest offering, no lack of crashes, but not even a minor concussion incurred or whatsoever.). After the series best FAST FIVE (2011, 7/10) and a degenerative FAST AND FURIOUS 6 (2013, 6/10), this time, the director chair has been delegated to James Wan, the master-hand behind SAW & INSIDIOUS horror trademarks, it is a sure-thing its box office will explode and achieve another series-high, but reckoning a story and cast overhaul is inevitable for its next move, let us take it as a sincere eulogy not only to Paul but the franchise itself. The cast continues ballooning with Jason Statham as the indomitable villain, and Tony Jaa makes his Hollywood debut in a thankless role as a heavy, with a has-been action star Kurt Russell back in the game with the hope to hog the position as a regular for the upcoming adventures. Universal surely is hatching a bigger plan for their top-ranking monkey-maker mammoth. The movie never veers from binging on its WTF spectacles, this time, the highlights include a car-parachuting stunt, an action-packed hostage-rescuing set piece ending with a science-defying cliff-hanger, and a car-swooping among three adjacent high-rises in Abu Dhabi. No doubt they are all thrilling to watch, and the admiration for the teamwork behind swells up spontaneously, which inadvertently overkills in the final showdown with a bombarding drone running amok in the city, personally it descends to a headache-inducing and eardrum-hurting nuisance because it drags too long and the hand-to-hand combat between Statham and Diesel fails to match its promise. Now, to the mushy part, as a half-finished swan-song of Walker, Wan and the screenwriter Chris Morgan choose the safest route for his exit strategy, with the aide of body doubles, CGI effects and montages of previous scenes, to say the least, fanboys will feel satisfactory and the due respect has been properly paid to the gone-too-soon. After all, the over- sensational phenomenon is not because the picture per se is the best of the series, purely, it is another victory of the ever-correct marketing tactic exploits on people's sentimentality on tragedies, which in some way, actually could give this enervated franchise a glance of hope to regain its vigour and keeps its life span. But for now, I can only wish R.I.P. for Paul, never a versatile actor, but a down-to-earth presence our generation hopefully will not forget in no time."
6,"This isn't a franchise to appeal to me . I think I gave up after the third film and the series does seem like a teen version of TOP GEAR with added silicone and steroids all shot in an MTV style that makes Michael Bay seem almost like Bela Tarr in comparison . So to be blunt I watched FURIOUS 7 just to see what the fuss was about and perhaps morbidly to see a film whose lead character is played by an actor who sadly died mid way through production To be fair it plays out very much as I expected for the first third . Car chases . explosions , pumping music playing the action , speed ramping , fisty-cuffs and karate kicks , constant slow motion every time the camera lingers on a semi-clad beauty and of course Jason Staham playing Jason Statham who looks like Daniel Day Lewis compared to Vin Diesel . What I have noticed in the gap between this and the last one I watched is how different this latest one feels from the early entries . From what I remember the original had a simple plot of a cop going undercover to break a gang of racers who've turned the streets of Los Angeles in to their own personal race track . It's not a brilliant premise for a film but it is a fairly sensible one . In spirit this one feels more like it belongs in an alternative universe similar to THE EXPENDABLES franchise or even James Bond . The action scenes are over blown and totally , totally ridiculous but to be fair I wasn't exactly bored by any of this and the cinema audience who were no doubt hard core fans of the films seemed to greatly enjoy it laughing out loud at the one liners so it's not a total dead loss and there is a meta-fictional feel that addresses towards the end that takes note that if the series continues it'll be without one of its mainstay characters played by Paul Walker In summary I was slightly surprised with FURIOUS 7 but much of my surprise is probably down to the fact I haven't watched most of the other movies and failed to see how the franchise evolved in to something different from its genesis . It probably won't win any new converts to its cause and I'm in no hurray to visit the films I missed but for those of you who enjoyed THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and stuck with the series you'll love this one"
6,"This movie is brilliant, when watched in the way it is supposed to be watched.It is over the edge, ridiculous mayhem in which the main characters don't bleed, the corny one liners never stop, and the sheer amount of testosterone pumping through it would destroy the planet.This is NOT a serious movie. This is a brilliantly done BAD movie and it is supposed to be watched that way.You have cars, hot chicks, hand to hand brawls, main hero can't die, Tony Jaa, explosions and action sequences that are Commando meets the Avengers meets Jason Bourne.What this is , ladies and gentlemen, could be only classified as the very pinnacle of trash movies. This is as good/bad as it gets.I will not go into analysis of scenes that would kill any normal person or Vin Diesel deadlifting 1,4 ton car, no sir , I will just express my gratitude for this entire series with which I practically grew up.It has made me happy. It served it's purpose to entertain. I never expected an artistical masterpiece of a movie, what I and hopefully everyone wanted was to have a hilarious amount of fun and they pulled it off.Finished it off with a nice homage to Paul Walker and made me walk out of the cinema with a smile on my face.I would give it a 10/10 but I have some amount of self control and objectiveness.The only bad thing done in this movie are the love scene dialogues. Vin was like a brick in them."
6,"Well this was a entertaining flick, but it does get really tiresome. I just really wanted to like this movie, since it's the sendoff movie for Paul Walker. But just got out of the theater feeling like it's just another average high budget action movie. That does have it's entertainment value, but is still easily forgettable. Now this series took a turn for something else starting with ""Fast Five"" with it focusing more on the action, missions and carnage over racing. So if I had to rate this movie from ""Fast Five"" which is my personal favorite in the franchise so far. I would have to say this is a tie with ""Fast 6"" since 6 had better elements when it comes to the directing, the story which is slightly better and more elements actually involving manuerability of the cars. This one has a slight edge when it comes to the entertainment value, so in a way this movie is slightly a guilty pleasure for me. I know they were trying to keep this movie light and fun despite all the carnage, but the humor in this really does flop. Like they were trying to be funny by going overboard but just comes off weak. I personally think Justin Lin is a better director than James Wan. Or maybe that has to do with the fact that Justin Lin stayed on longer with this franchise, anyways I liked the directing style of Lin better. But props to Wan for tackling his first super high budget Hollywood movie. When it comes to this installment, it's like Wan thought up different ways of how many times a car can drive off a high place and how many times people can jump out of a moving vehicle. Since the chase scenes has been done quite a lot in the previous two installments. I personally lost count when it comes to that. However I think Wan also though up fights that the fans would want. Like Jason Statham vs. The Rock, Jason Statham vs. Vin Diesel and Ronda Rousey fighting some other protagonist. The constant pushing in the romance between Dom and Letty just made the movie drag and is probably the most boring part about this movie. Sure it can have a bit o romance, but let's focus on the main plot. Cause the romance in this is stale and far from being immersive. The scene stealer in this is Jason Statham, cause he is by far the most badass villain this franchise has had so far. Which is a shame since it felt like he had less screen time and interactions than Luke Evans. Overall this is a entertaining action movie that is worth a watch, despite it getting really tiresome near the end.6.8/10"
6,"just saw Fast and furious 7. It was cool but i liked the previous two better.the story and action sequence on this was average at best but surprisingly Tyrese and Ludicrous kept this film from not sinking ship for me as there banter and on screen times were great.I felt some of the main casts wasn't executed well in this movie and could have done so better.Lots of plot holes i must say. Before you harp on about how action movies have thin plot holes to begin with, well the reason why no one expects or cares how great the plot is, is because the actual action of a movie is suppose to distract you from thinking about the plot.Sadly this movie didn't and i was counting the amount of plot holes in this movie.One thing that didn't help either is how the trailer practically revealed the best action sequences of the movie.I am getting fed up with trailers. During my time at the cinema they showed what seemed to be a 10min trailer of mad max. Luckily and buried my head under my shirt for 10mins trying to avoid the trailers of that movie.Without adding spoiler tags by spoiling the movie, the last scene of the movie was the best scene and you will find out why.I am still gutted about Paul Walker passing away as he seemed like a genuine cool level headed person. It must have been very hard for the supporting casts filming this.this gets a 6.5/10 for me"
6,"Something is missing in this movie if you compare the earlier parts. Action in this movie is outstanding no doubt in that direction is also good but i don't know there is something missing in this movie may be due to long cast and you get confused which one you like most or you see again and again which you were notice in after ""Expendables 1"".Story is also i feel very predictable not that kind of surprising. The real x factor of F&F was missing in this movie. I must say movie can get a good business but if seen earlier part of this series you feel the difference. As a viewer we expected a lot from this cast but this time just above average."
6,"Surely the sad final with the metaphoric departure of Paul Walker hit everyone that loved this saga, when he was a child and watched the firsts movie.But beyond this touching tribute, we have to see, critically, what's this movie factually is. And it is, as the lasts chapters, an anonymous action movie that on a side lost all his race characteristics (supercars are introduced just as a spectacular elements, without an unchangeable role in the plot) and on the other risks to lose itself in the sea of mediocre action movies. The introduction of Jason Statham confirms officially this evolution as before did the entrance of Dwayne Johnson. And in fact the movie is full of long, predictable fights with or without arms where those that in the firsts film were pilots now are kind of ninja or 007: I really don't understand how Dominic Toretto can raise a car just with his hands or destroy the street with the foot.In conclusion, the movie is a sufficient action, that forgets the most part of its supercar movie and concentrate all its efforts producing a commercial ""sparatutto"", with all the negative points of a entertaining movie (bad dialogues, annoying irony, superficial characters etc)."
6,"There's a distinct lack of plot or character in 'Furious 7 (2015)', outside of the most basic of foundations already laid in previous entries, and the feature floats along from each outlandish set-piece to the next with little in-between. The action is generally well done, even if the hand-to-hand is a bit iffy and Paul Walker's digital reconstructions are too obvious, and I can't deny that I was having fun most of the time, though. It isn't realistic but it never claims to be and, even though it is floating further and further from its street racing roots, the series is still somehow decent seven pictures in. 6/10"
6,"When i saw the trailer for the upcoming Fast&Furious 7 i was really disappointed.Especially after fast 6 the franchise was getting away for its primary target: ""Street Racing"" and not forget the second point: ""illegal"". If you compare the first movie and the last one you will barely noticed that is the same movie.The only same are the actors and the brand name, nothing else.We have in 2001 a small mid-level garage with import Japanese cars and cost's up to 60k $ which to keep them running they are involved to TV and DVD theft to high level ""agents"",racing with Ferrari's,Tesla's and car's above to 3 million dollars.Are you kidding me?As a car enthusiast i was expecting to see car chase,illegal modifications and more street racing.If you see fast 7 you can barely notice street racing.In conclusion Fast 7 was to me more like a mix from old scenes of fast&furious franchise,action and more fighting like Taken or Expendables (should we expect and liam neeson in the next movie?),a little drama and a small taste from bollywood (especially the scenes with Ramsey and Hobbs).If you like movies with action and fight,then Fast 7 is perfect but if you are a car fan you will be disappointed.I saw the movie because of Paul.If Fast&furious 8 would confirmed i would be waiting for the DVD release.A really disappointed fan Universal."
6,In some ways its a great action film and in other ways its a total joke. Its a lot of fun to watch crazy car chases but the man to man fight scenes were 'over the top.' You don't get hit in the head with a 25 pound monkey wrench and just shake your head and keep fighting. Its a lot of stuff like that-death blows just pissing off characters- repeatedly-that gave me a bit of irritation. This type of film making is all about bigger faster and more action-so I suppose it all makes sense in the context of the movie but at the same time time I thought they might have toned down the Godzilla versus Hercules fight sequences into something that would apply to human beings. Its still watchable as good action film. I think this franchise never had a future beyond this film anyway for what its worth now that they probably won't be making any more of them due to Paul Walker not being around anymore.I only give it a six because of the abundance of unrealistic fight scenes. Its not supposed to be a Rocky movie.
6,"Granted that I can't claim to be a fan of the ""Fast & Furious"" series, but still have managed to gotten around to watching them all whenever the chance presented itself. Though this is definitely not movies that will lure me to the cinema. It took me about two years after its initial release to get around to watching ""Furious 7""; yeah, these movies are not high on my to-watch-list.""Furious 7"" was every bit as I had expected, which wasn't much. Sure, there is an abundance of cars and action here, which is essentially the only thing that the franchise is about.Story-wise, then ""Furious 7"" was every bit up to par with the previous six movies. So if you enjoyed those previous movies, you will also enjoy this one. Just don't expect storytelling on a grand scale.Personally I can't claim to have any interest in Vin Diesel or his inability to act and his monotone delivery of every single line. However, Jason Statham, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez is what I enjoy watching in this franchise. The cast is actually quite alright, and has been so throughout the entire franchise. It was quite nice to have Tony Jaa and Kurt Russell show up in ""Furious 7"".There is a lot of action and cars in the movie, as I mentioned earlier. Personally I don't care much about cars in any way or fashion, so that has little appeal to me. The action, however, now that was top notch. Actually, some of the scenes were just so over the top and campy that it was hard not to laugh at how ludicrous of it all was. I mean, the scene where Dwayne Johnson breaks off his cast and goes to pick up a Gatling gun to take on a helicopter was just too much. I was actually ready to turn off the movie when they dropped out of an airplane in their cars and almost all of them practically managed to land spot on the road, that was just downright ridiculous. And finally the scene where they had a car jump through three buildings was also seriously too much.""Furious 7"" is definitely a movie made for the male audience, so it is filled with testosterone, cars and action.While it certainly is an entertaining movie, it is also a movie that you shouldn't take too seriously, because it is just blown way out of proportions and lacks a sense of realism. ""Furious 7"" is hardly a groundbreaking movie by any means, but proved to be just as entertaining as the previous six movies in the franchise."
6,"I wanted to like this. Really, I did! As Paul Walkers final film, I was hoping they would have done something interesting and different with the story and they did. But not in a good way.In essence, they tried to turn Furious 7 into Mission Impossible. Before very long in the movie, the gang are working for ""Da Man"" - in this case Kurt Russel - and helping him recover a piece of technology for the security forces. Said technology will then be used to help them find Jason Statham's character, who is out to get them.Sounds reasonable, right? Unfortunately, this premise is quickly overwhelmed with utterly ridiculous nonsense such as cars parachuting out of a plane to land perfectly on a winding mountain road; Coaches armed with mini-guns down the sides like some kind of road-going galleon; Reinforced concrete parking structures that collapse like they are sandcastles on a beach; People fighting and hitting each other in the face with plumber's wrenches and barely even feeling it.You get the idea? It is ridiculous. As if they just decided to ramp up the stupid and to hell with it.So is it really that bad? Well, I guess if you have no understanding of how the real world works - physics, gravity and so on - then I suppose it is a decent enough action film. The problem really lies with how this movie takes itself far too seriously. None of the aforementioned excesses would be out of place in a comedy spy film. Yet here, they just stand out. Instead of saying ""Whoah! Did they just do that?"" you end up saying ""You've gotta be effing shitting me!"" Furious 7 is a parody of its own franchise, piling on the impossible action and saying ""To hell with the consequences"". After the previous outing, I didn't think they could make it any more unbelievable, but they have.The result is an unsatisfying movie where nobody dies except the bad guys and everyone has Neo-like abilities when it comes to defying gravity and physics. It's just too much. Far from being a fitting send-off to the franchise, it just ends up teeth-grittingly annoying and tiresome.So was there anything good? Well, there was some interesting camera-work in the early fight sequences, with the camera following characters as they rolled around. Literally the camera rolled with them. Quite a nice effect, actually. The car driving was, as usual, enjoyable to watch, though the stunts were less so.However, other than that, there is little to recommend this movie apart from the silliness. If you've seen other F&F movies, this one is just more of the same, but done in such an over-the-top manner as to make it tedious, not exciting.SUMMARY: Beyond ridicule. Too much excess that no one tried to reign in. Tries to reinvent itself as a spy-action movie. Not so much Mission Impossible, as Mostly Impossible."
6,"To watch this film you must have a mind that does not nitpick and that can look over the impossible stunts that are performed in this film. It is amazing some of the visuals but it is just so ridiculous it takes away from the film. It gives it that impossible feel that I don't think suites this film. I am all for seeing a bus go off a cliff in an action sequence but with the stupidity that one of the characters escapes to then jump on a spoiler is something I cannot accept. I did enjoy the characters to some extent and I could take on board the story of Jason Statham's character view on them attacking his family. However I would of much preferred seeing them go head to head rather than him just jumping into the plot for the story convenience. It seemed a bit forced. But I had come to expect this from the Fast and Furious franchise. This is a perfect film to put on when there is nothing else to watch or when it is on television for a bit of mindless action. But I do not thing it is a great thing for action films of the future to take a leap from this film as I assume the one billion it will make worldwide will influence more films to come. I would like to see some plausibility to the action and think ""wow that could of happened"". Not ""wow this is stupid"" when i see a car go through three skyscrapers and they some how survive. After all of this the tribute to Paul Walker was a very touching moment and it is one I will re-watch as I did like the chemistry with all the characters. Paul Walker was probably the best of the bunch which will be a miss to this franchise. Overall I would actually recommend watching this film however know what you are getting yourself into. you will not be seeing an action film that will bend your mind but you will see one that will make you think how stupid some of the scenes are. 6/10"
6,"This is a bit hard to review because we all know what happened due filming this flick, the sudden death by car accident of Paul Walker. Excellent the way he's seen throughout this flick and in the last minutes were Vin Diesel is saying stuff towards him and an ode is shown towards Paul I can understand that some fans will wipe away a tear. It's really sad what happened of course but we are stuck with part 7 and for me it was all over the top.it picked up were part 6 left and that was fine until the cars come out of an airplane. From there on the whole movie is an over the top action flick. If it would have been a movie on it's own it would have been great, style 007 or Mission Impossible but hey, face it, it is still Fast And Furious. We do have car chases and naturally in the beginning German Junk Car lost it from the US Muscle Car, that was good but overall, it was more about the action. The car jumping from building to building, doesn't fit for me in a F&F flick. So I'm left with a bitter feeling. It do has an open ending so up to part 8 but really, let's go back a bit more towards the cars in stead of action like this. Part 6 was fine to see and is was just limited in action to not exaggerate the action. What can I say, not really my thing this time.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5"
6,"Furious 7 (2015): Dir: James Wan / Cast: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Kurt Russell: A vast improvement over a franchise that burns more rubber than ideas. This entry is better plotted and written with more detail than what is expected. Jason Statham makes for a nasty villain Deckard Shaw who is out for revenge after the bludgeoning defeat of his brother in the previous film. He first sends Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson to the hospital after a brutal battle following his hacking his computer for the names of the team that took his brother down. Central plot regards Shaw stalking them and making lethal attempts at their lives. There is also an interesting subplot weaved within regarding a hacker who needs to be rescued to complete the mission. Finally, we have impossibly corny yet entertaining race action sequences where cars careen through skyscraper windows towards other skyscrapers. Vin Diesel returns as team leader Dom who engages in a street fight with Shaw, but his main concern is his team as well as his wife's amnesia. Paul Walker unfortunately met with an untimely death before film completion. As Brian, his wife, who is Dom's sister is expecting a second child. Michelle Rodriguez plays the feisty Letty, Dom's wife who struggles with memory loss. Statham is a terrific addition as Shaw, as well as Kurt Russell as an agent recruiting Dom and his team for a duel mission. Don't expect anything above mindless action and stunts that are way off the grid. Do expect a film that rises above previous films plus gives Paul Walker a nice montage sendoff before the credits. Score: 6 / 10"
6,"It's an understatement that the films in this franchise are getting crazier and increasingly unrealistic with each successive installment. And Furious 7 takes that to yet unseen levels. But then, realism never really was an expectation here was there ? The earlier films though, were at least grounded in some level to the extent that you could at least believe what you saw if you stretched your imaginations far enough. This one takes believability to, as Roman would say it, a whole new level.Sample this: After the events of the previous installment, Owen Shaw's brother, Deckard is out for revenge against Toretto and his crew. To get to them though, he needs to know where they are. So, he breaks into the DSS' headquarters (which looks completely desolated with only Hobbs and Elena working there) and into Hobbs' computer scanning for information on their whereabouts (which, as we were led to believe from the previous installments, were erased with the crew receiving full pardons). He then begins taking them out one by one starting with Hobbs (who Shaw manages to injure badly so as to land him in a hospital) and followed by Han (which connects the franchise to Tokyo Drift) and then Dom and Mia (who barely manage to escape). In the middle of all this, comes a terrorism plot about a certain ""Mr.Nobody ""who is after a device codenamed ""God's Eye"" that can turn any camera into a tracking device of sorts allowing its owner to spy on anyone. A terrorist wants to use it for his personal gains but to do so, he requires the assistance of the device's creator - a hot female hacker named Ramsey who Mr. Nobody wants Dom and his crew to rescue since only she knows where the device is. All of this is of course, carried forward by the franchise's trademark over-the-top and highly unbelievable set of action sequences, fast race cars and even bikini-clad chicks in a scene or two.The series seems to have settled on a formula of sorts with a silly plot governed by cringe-worthy lines of dialog relying on its action to do the talking not to mention the amount of times the term last / final is used in the franchise (One Last Ride, One Last Mission, etc.). While the set-pieces here are good enough, they lack the awesomeness of the ones in Fast Five and Furious 6 (which is gonna be hard to top with a tank and a plane). The final sequence drags on for so long with actors doing nothing but mouthing search and rescue dialogues amidst heavily inter-cut action I stopped caring about the outcomes of the characters themselves. The fight sequences too seem to have seemingly odd camera angles as if the director of photography ran out of angles to shoot from.Why then, have I rated this movie a 6 you wonder. That's because it all does come together to create a decent entertainment package. But more importantly, this is largely due to the tribute to Paul Walker at the end that, unexpectedly, feels so heart-wrenching its surprising. After all, its a Fast & Furious movie; it isn't supposed to be this emotional. But the cast give such a fitting send-off to Walker's character in movie it resonates largely with the real life situation. As for the CGI Paul Walker that some people seem to be cringing about, except for some shots in the end, I honestly couldn't make out which shots used his digital double in the film (I did have some guesses but they turned out wrong).I do believe that a lot of the high praise that the movie is getting has to do with this being Walker's final movie as also to the tribute at the end. Otherwise, its a fairly average action movie with a brainless plot that at times, reminded me of the crazy Bollywood movies that a lot of people criticize. Given the money its making and the fact that this is Universal's most reliable and only huge franchise for now, I won't be surprised if we get one of these every two years for the next decade at the least. Watch it, if nothing else, For Paul !!!"
6,"Vin Diesel may have been the most indelible trademark of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise, but its late star Paul Walker has consistently been the Yang to Diesel's Yin. It is no secret that 'Furious 7' is Walker's final performance, an inevitable consequence of his untimely death in a car wreck last year while filming on this latest instalment was underway. All we will say is that its writer Chris Morgan has given him as dignified a farewell as we can expect, and as the epilogue made up of footage from each one of the movies past echoed Diesel's personal message of brotherhood and family, be prepared for perhaps the series' most poignant moment ever. This however we will say – Walker is front and centre in each and every one of the action setpieces that Morgan and its new director James Wan conceive for a solid but otherwise unspectacular entry which can't quite match the fun, excitement and adrenaline kicks of Justin Lin's two earlier chapters. Oh yes, the filmmakers have pushed the boundaries of logic and gravity to try to top the over-the-top thrills of its two predecessors, but ironically the strain of their effort is more apparent than ever.Indeed, it is telling when a car chase along the streets of Los Angeles no longer gets our pulse racing in the same way that the first movie did – and there is one in particular between Dominic and his arch-nemesis here Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) that is particularly nostalgic. Rather, it will take parachuting Mustangs chasing after a rogue paramilitary unit up in the Caucasus mountains led by Djimon Hounsou's terrorist Jakande to get us to truly sit up, but let us reassure you that this sequence teased in the trailer ranks among the finest that this muscle-car franchise has offered. It takes close to an hour to get to this point, as Morgan sets up the vendetta between Deckard and Dominic (and as his crew) and set in motion the pieces for their latest adventure.Frankly, the plot exists only as the narrative glue for the various stunts meant to be the highlight of any 'Fast and Furious' movie. There is no point questioning just why Kurt Russell's shadowy Government agent would entrust a supposedly time-critical mission of retrieving an all-seeing surveillance programme known as the 'God's Eye' and its creator (Nathalie Emmanuel's Ramsey) to Dominic and his men without so much as having his own team to stand by. Ditto for why Dominic would even agree to put his men in such danger despite being promised that they could use the said device to track down Deckard, in particular since the latter seems to show up on his own accord at every turn to foil their plans. We get that the franchise needs to shift gears in order to stay fresh (like how the fifth movie reinvented itself into a heist caper), but this detour into international espionage is far less convincing to say the least. It also explains why we were not quite taken by the sojourn into the United Arab Emirates capital of Abu Dhabi, compared to say the favelas of Rio de Janeiro in 'Fast Five' or the streets of London in 'Furious 6'. Yes, it does provide the opportunity for Dominic to crash a Lykan HyperSport out through one of the upper floors of the Etihad Towers, float across the Abu Dhabi sky while Deckard fires grenades at him, then smash through a window of a neighbouring tower, and finally skid past a small deployment of Terracotta Warriors – but it is so ridiculous even by 'Mission Impossible' standards that one cannot help but react with bemusement than wide- eyed awe. That leaves an overblown finale in the most literal sense of the word, which sees Jakande strike up a convenient alliance with Deckard in order to unleash war on Dominic and his men in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. Between Jakande's unmanned drone and his military helicopter, the urban warfare cannot quite match the white knuckle suspense and exhilaration of a massive bank vault dragged through Rio or an assembly of race cars taking down an airplane as it prepares to take off.Certainly, Wan had big shoes to fill with Lin's departure, but the helmer (better known for 'Saw', 'Insidious' and 'The Conjuring') who has never taken on a project of this scale misses the mark on several counts. Not only is the action more 'meh' than 'wow', there is too little of the camaraderie between Dominic and his crew which gave the last two films an added 'zing'. Just as sorely missed is the dynamic between Diesel and Dwayne Johnson's Federal Agent Hobbs, the latter of which pretty much sits out the whole movie after being injured by Deckard in one of the early scenes – and despite what promise it may have shown, the mano-a-mano showdown between Diesel and Statham cannot quite live up to that between Diesel and Johnson in 'Fast Five'.After the dizzying heights of the immediate last two movies, it seems inevitable that 'Furious 7' will be at least slightly underwhelming – and if not for the beautiful sendoff for Paul Walker at the end, it would be even more disappointing. At this point, the franchise seems to be its own enemy, and if we weren't quite so taken by 'Furious 7', that's because we knew from 'Fast Five' and 'Furious 6' that it could have been much better."
6,"I think this season is the best in this series. In Japanese, this movie is titled ""Wild speed Sky mission"". After watching this movie, I agree with the reason which this movie is called ""sky mission"" in spite of car action movie. As this title, action is very brilliant. On the other hand, O'Conner got his son, so he has something to wanna save. This gap is also interesting. What I was disappointed is the story line. I think more clear what and why they do these mission, we can get into the movie world more. Through all the season, O'Conner's posts were very important for these movies. (I was disappointed that O'Conner in this season isn't so.) I like O'Conner very much, so after the next season I can see him. I'm sorry for Paul Walker's loss."
6,"There was one race scene, one convoy scene, one get away scene, and one chase scene. The first Fast and Furious had at least three or four of each. The settings have become a little more diverse with at least three different regions of the world represented. Less race scenes meant less street tuners though some of the armored mods were still innovative. Overall the attitude of the Fast and Furious saga had been toned down from careless joy rides to now saving the world! Paul Walker's death definitely changed the relationships and trust amongst the familiar cast. Most visible was the change in Vin Diesel's acting. Tony Jaa was suppressed since he could definitely beat anyone there in a martial arts contest, and any action actor was suited for Jason Statham's hyped role. Tyrese and Ludicrous were still exchanging funny insults for the babes, and Dwayne Johnson always keeps energetic and motivating."
6,"It is a good thing the franchise sampled the heist element into its defining genre of car and culture, otherwise hardly would it have reached the level it has now. Growing through sequel after sequel, in this seventh installment of the beloved, sentimentally-charged series, the only problem is - it goes beyond adequacy.Finally stitching together the third film and its sequels, the plot takes you on a revenge game from the antagonist's side. The Toretto-O'Connor family has developed over the years, and the sentimentality is all over the place, giving the plot a considerable dose of melodrama. But the past is back to haunt them as Shaw (Statham) is vowing to avenge his brother's free-fall from that never-ending runway in the sixth film. Starting with an attack on Hobbs (The Rock), Shaw visits Dom and gang from time to time like he's an insurance agent coming in for monthly checks. All he does is arrive, talk, shoot few bullets and beautiful grenades, and leave.Then the plot drifts to a side story about a hacker who is being pursued by a dumb marauder. Unfortunately the primary bad guy (Statham), as one can possibly detect, has a screen space less than that of the Indian lad Ali Fazal. He is vindictive, agreed, but switching ON and OFF between the scenes is equivalent to a show without a villain. It mostly looked like that Dom and his gang are fighting and driving for nothing. That is confirmed when in the second half you see all of Hollywood crammed into one big setting, where all rules of science, logic, and common sense go take a hike. The second biggest problem with the plot is that Hobbs, who as an anti-hero changed the way the audience saw The Fast & The Furious series evolve, is left out. It was a delight watching him in the last two films, but in here, he is not even given his fair share of comedy. Tyrese may make you laugh with maintained humor, but he definitely overdoes it. However, fans expecting explosions WILL get explosions. After tanks and freighters, here we have flying cars and buses fit with machine guns. The action goes couple of notches higher, with breathtaking (is the right word) sequences helped by beautiful photography. The camera work is better due to the use of slow-motion stunts. If you take the advice I have mentioned in the summary, you will find delight in watching these scenes that unfold in the first half. Second half is tedious and draggy. With a climax that lasts an eternity adds further boredom to the viewing experience and makes Hollywood look like Bollywood. Even the music is a let down.The character of Letty (Rodriguez) was best left dead, because she is one player causing sameness in the film. With that silver Christ locket exchanging necks and hands more than a regular one dollar bill, it would have been wiser to prune the family business, now that Mrs. O'Connor is being cast only for the purpose of producing babies. Diesel is fine, Statham is badly cast, while Walker is purportedly the man of the show. A glorious tribute at the end closes the show with a tear.BOTTOM LINE: Watchable, because it very well defines what the franchise is all about - ones and zeros as in binary which relates to fear and loyalty as in family. So, limit your brain and experience the high-octane drama. 6/10.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
6,"Just came out to see Fast & Furious 7 last night.I was expecting a lot from the movie, especially from the crazy unrealistic stunts they pull out for some times. I was not disappointed on that part, the first part of the movie gives great stunts and shots, a lot of humor, a real Fast & Furious.However the movie lacks a lot in it's second part. The finale is long and boring. We are stuck for more that 30m with a chase between a car and a drone, repetitive, unimaginative, dark, without much meaning.I left the movie with mix feelings, I had both a good time and a bored time.While I do appreciate the farewell to Paul Walker at the end of the movie, I found it even more troubling regarding the storyline of that movie.It was touching, but it just doesn't makes sense in the movie. Toretto is leaving the beach... alone as if he was leaving everybody. Brian follows him, they ride and they split. All of those shots with good narrative on how much they will miss him...In the storyline, what is the points of those words? There is no clue whatsoever that Brian is going to die (does he have cancer in terminal phase or something?), Considering they intend to do a F&F8 and F&F9, I was hoping they would set up the next movies, especially what will happen to Brian, they didn't.I give that movie a 6, I think it is still worth a 7, but I found the ratings so far overrated"
6,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh."
6,"I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.
phenoix performence is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrums of performence.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there."
6,"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker."
6,"The performance of Joaquin is excellent but the story simply don't have anything to do with the Joker, it's more about a mentaly ill man struggling with his chaotic enviroment until it's overwhelmed and snaps. I would be a much better film if the title was ""Arthur"" or ""The Clown"" but the fact that it's forced to be related to the batman universe it's why i feld it didn't work."
6,"What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a ""masterpiece"" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy."
6,"Strong fanboy and hype rush going on.
The movie is good don't get me wrong, the cinematography is amazing, the acting is brilliant, but the story is a bit predictable if you have an iq above 90. Its also really slow paced which can be annoying at times. Deff has it flaws and is in no way even comparable to Batman the dark knight. The movie is a 7 but I gave it a 6 to compensate for all the fanboy 10s"
6,"Just to say that the film left me wanting to watch ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver"" the whole time, plus a few of the other films that this film strongly references. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic however and the film has all the top production values that you'd expect of a big studio picture but it's generic and predicable in my opinion. It takes from so much that it's not it's own film for me. By no means is the film awful, it's just soulless. I'm not trying to be deliberately obtuse and against the tide of support for this film either, there are things as I've mentioned to commend and I'd like to add that going the way of gritty R rated film making is what I've wanted for years, from a more dramatic viewpoint, I thought ""Logan"" did what this film failed to do for me as a darker comic book oriented film. I hope people can respect my opinion just as I respect the free speech of everyone who really liked the film. Finally, I will add that those who have bashed the film for violence do not know what they're talking about. There are far more violent films than this and if one person or even a handful of people were incentivised to cause harm to others, the rest of us shouldn't have to pay for the odd few thank you very much. It's an interesting watch for certain and I'd recommend watching for that reason alone."
6,"Some great moments, doesn't really live up to the hype though.
Phoenix's prediction of Joker's descent into madness was really interesting to watch and he will get many plaudits but the film felt like it was missing something. A few plot holes and areas where you feel like it's being dragged out longer than it needs to be. Definitely worth a watch, but don't go in expecting to see a 'film of the year'.
Ledger still on top."
6,"I found nothing interesting or artistic about this movie, it's just a meaningless show which pretends something meaningful"
6,"Watched the movie, it was a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it was a performance of a man going insane. The story being about Joker is an offshoot. The Thomas Wayne character is overdone and cocky. DO NOT see this movie as a DC comic version of the Joker it is not."
6,"Don't listen to the unbelievably high average score, this is not a great movie. It leans on cliches, it struggles to communicate vital character details, but it manages to pull together a strong closing act to elevate an otherwise inconsistent film.'Joker' stumbles out of the gate by throwing a plethora of ""troubled loner"" cliches at us. The scenes read almost as a list, giving the early stages of the film a disjointed feel that hampers any sense of immersion. The only aspect of our lead, Arthur Fleck, that seems original is his affliction. His sudden outbursts of laughter during tense situations are used to great effect several times throughout the first act.As the story continues, 'Joker' wastes time on a sub-par subplot involving Arthur's neighbor. Another sub-plot, involving Thomas Wayne, is far more interesting and clever in its execution.Ultimately, 'Joker' becomes a story of Arthur breaking free and flourishing in the chaos of Gotham. The final act revels in his now unrestrained insanity. However, the film struggles to convey a clear image of what exactly is happening within Arthur. Is he an idiot savant, or a brilliant mastermind set free of his bonds. You can go back through the film if you wish and identify plot points to either effect if you wish (the latter seems more likely in retrospect). However, this failure of communication lessens the impact of the film, leaving you somewhat disappointed.Nevertheless, the final act is an exciting close to the film, though it probably should have ended about 5 minutes earlier than it did (the final scene is unneeded). Regardless, the result is a unique and fascinating comic book movie held back from greatness by a shaky start and questionable communication."
6,"Plot holes aside (If the entire Gotham is so vicious, who is Batman gonna save it for... the filthy rich? He's SUPPOSED to be a hero for goodness sake), the film paints a masterful portrait of a back story. Now they just have to find a super villain whose life it fits."
6,"There is no doubt in my mind that Joaquin Phoenix deserves at least an Oscar nod, if not the trophy itself. In an odd way, he reminded me of Sean Penn in that when you watch him, you forget he is an actor, all you see is the character. In reality, the rest of the cast were merely props in this one-man show... even Robert De Niro.There are a lot of Easter Eggs as nods to other films of the late 70s and early 80s, which was cool.As an origin story in the comic book universe, Joker was good, better than most. I do not judge movies based on how closely they follow a book or if they follow the rules of physics, but more if they entertain me and allow me to escape my reality for a few hours. In that sense, Joker left me wanting for more. Yeah, there are political nods that you can read into this, but they weren't forced onto the viewer, more of a backdrop.The randomness of Joker's thinking and thoughts was in a word, distracting. Because the director put me in the lead character's psychosis, I had a hard time sympathizing with any character in the movie, which makes it difficult to connect to the story.Maybe the real genius of the movie was that randomness, seeing the world through the psychotic mind of the Joker. But it didn't make for a hugely entertaining experience for me."
6,"Just came home from the cinema. My five cents: It's basically taxi driver 2 with a Joaquin phoenix overplaying pretty much every scene. I thought it was entertaining and beautifully shot, but not my favourite movie of the year. And come on, that ending with him at the show admitting killing those three guys without anyone doing anything. That was a bit too much."
6,"Ok so been to see the JOKER on the back of all the reviews on here saying its a cinematic masterpiece etc etc, and while i cant argue that Phoenix certainly gives an acting masterclass the actual movie itself is dare i say it a bit slow, and a tad boring ( i dont care if you dont agree ) and as for the Joker himself he is no where near as good as the one portrayed by Heath Ledger and no where near as scary.
The Joker here comes across as a sad pitiful character who in all honesty needs a swift boot in the short and curlies followed by a good wash.After i watched the Dark Knight i could not wait to see it again but certainly dont feel that way about JOKER"
6,"Pros are obviously Joaquin is amazing and the direction is competent and it's beautiful and I actually liked a lot of the changes they've made Bc it's an origins story. Cinematography= excellent. I love the grittiness, the swearing, the constant chain smoking, the blood, the scene in the apt when he murders the guy with the knife and lets the little man go was great, the girlfriend thing being all in his head was great, joaquins dancing was great....Cons= a lot of the writing was just lazy. He got away from murder way too easily (literally nobody was in the subway tunnel= needlessly convenient) the murders of 3 random punk kids starting a crazy movement of violence was unbelievable and stupid (they weren't important at all just 3 rich kids with no explanation?) although I liked the idea of Thomas Wayne being a bad guy pretty much every scene with him was stupid (the joker sneaks into the theatre so easily during the protests=stupid) the end where he gets murdered in the alley during the violence was really stupid and so lazy (the guy was running for mayor and had no body guards or anything= totally forced the Batman connection). I liked the themes but they were way too overt, like when he basically rants on tv about his mental illness before shooting Robert deniro... totally not like the joker at all... I don't care if it's supposed to be like that.. it could have been a lot more subtle and natural but wasn't... and finally, although it was gritty and dark... I feel like they were still way too careful and preachy... like I was expecting him to kill a lot more people and honestly hoping for it because that's what the joker does especially for his origin story! Everyone is obsessing over it and saying it's amazing but I really just think that it fell short on Way too many levels. Worth the watch and definitely more bold than most but could've been great and simply isn't."
6,"This is ""Joker"", a 2019 movie and the title is really telling what/who it is about. But first things first: The director is Todd Phillips and he is also one of several writers working on the screenplay for this 2-hour movie. Phillips is still mostly known for his Hangover films probably and in general for his collaborations with Zach Galifianakis. So gently-speaking, the filmmaker's career is not exactly filled with projects that were received greatly by critics. This one here is no exception either. General movie-goers apparently really loved it, but critics not so much. A bit like Bohemian Rhapsody not too long ago. That one I really adored though, this one here not so much. Still I am a big Joaquin Phoenix fan and as such, it is impossible to give the film a thumbs-down overall. He is the movie. And I am really glad he plays the title character because otherwise I maybe would not have liked it at all. Not just because of personal preference, but also because Phoenix really is that good from beginning to end and he is in almost every scene. Not too long ago, Jared Leto played the Joker (Batman's nemesis) and there was a lot of hype surrounding his turn that quickly vanished because he really did not have too much screen time at all and stayed pale in comparison to Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. But lets not drift away from this film here now. For Phoenix, all the hype is justified and well-deserved. I think he is still up there and a potential contender for the Oscar win this year with his nomination pretty much a safe deal and I read that it could be between him and Adam Driver and I like both for being slightly oddball, so I certainly approve. Of course with stuff like Her, The Master and my personal favorite Walk the Line under his belt, it is arguable if this one here should be the movie for which he gets a golden statuette, but I still hope he does. If we consider Daniel Day-Lewis retired now, he is probably the best actor working right now and as he is still under 50, that is quite impressive. At least in my opinion, but he is just so consistent and constantly adds depth to his characters in a way where you feel nobody else could have done it this well. He does so much with his eyes. Okay you get the message, I thought he was an amazing Joker.Sadly I cannot say the same about the film itself really. There are good moments here and there, no denying at all, but I was still not satisfied with the script I must say. It felt to me that, most of all, they were taking the safe route basically and going the way where it would obviously be a crowd pleaser, but somehow I must say that the film felt zero daring to me. Even the interactions with the Wayne family that could easily really have been goosebump material, felt a bit shoddy and for the sake of it all. I did like, however, that the way things seemed to turn out we thought it would definitely be the Joker who kills Bruce's father in the end because of the personal connection, but it was just one of his ""army"" eventually and it does not matter who did it. Joker is not really getting his hands dirty at that point anymore, he has others who do so for him. Also pay attention to how everybody who means something to him early on (his mother, De Niro's character most of all) are killed by him. I must say I did wonder though how they did not try to catch him after he strangles his mother. I mean as for the colleague at his apartment, it made more sense because the time between that and the show appearance was perhaps too short. But still the cops were following him and that was accurate. There, however, Clownmania was already going on in full force you could say. Big enough though for police not to go to the studio and arrest him right away? I would say I disagree. In general, this is a film where you can never really be sure how much of it is real and how much just happens in the protagonist's head. Like his relationship with the neighbor, but that is just the obvious one where we know it is fake, even if I did not see it coming. Of course also the relationship between his mother and Mr. Wayne (okay that seemed fairly far-fetched from the beginning, I mean Joker cannot be Batman's half-brother can he?) or the medical condition he has in terms of laughing or the idea about De Niro's character early on almost acting like a father figure to him in front of the camera, which most likely was fake too because there were no references later on that it was not his first time on the show. So this is a film that will certainly play with your head continuously because the only moments you can be 100% sure they are real and actually happening are those that include a great deal of violence, such as the killing of the three young men on the subway. Or the talk show host murder. Or the killing of his mother? Or maybe is that fake too? I mean it is a big step, even if she did invent the relationship with Bruce's dad. He really really cares for her. And he won't kill the colleague who always treated him well. I thought it was a psycho trick that he left the door closed and tthe guy is too small to reach the knob/key, but no he really just forgot it and lets him go eventually. He is a psychopath yes, but with his very own unpredictable style. Of course, there are aside from that these moments with all the over-the-top laughing, most notably when he visits the comedy show and laughs each and every time everybody else stays quiet and stays quiet himself when they are laughing at the punch lines. Now that was kinda hilarious because of how awkward it felt and also very telling because we saw how he totally did not fit in with everybody else, the average people.Okay, I think this would be pretty much all then. I mentioned some of the scenes that stayed most memorable to me. Maybe, most likely, you have different scenes that fit the description for you and that is perfectly fine because there are so many to pick from. There is hardly one that is really weak and I think the running time was accurate too and I don't say that too often about 2-hour movies that they should not have kept it a bit shorter on some occasions, so you can see it as a compliment. But like I mentioned previously already, those scenes that did stand out mostly did so because of Phoenix giving it his best and not really because of great writing. I think the dialogue writing was still a bit better than the writing of the action and what the characters were doing compared to saying, which sometimes made me forgot about the relatively weak ways in which the story was progressing. This also applies especially to the idea of everybody getting more and more crazy out there somehow. There is a fairly memorable quote from Fleck (Joker in his ""human form"") about that that they really could have made a lot with (also they included it in the trailer) story-wise, but the way they included the clown army for example felt really out of nowhere and it did not make too much sense to me. Okay we get it. Gotham is not at a good place to be right now, but with such a movement you just have to come up with a better explanation and elaboration and lead us there more convincingly. Okay that would be all then I liked and disliked about this film. It certainly won't make it into my top10 movies of the year and if it gets in at the Oscars for Best Picture, that is too much I think, but I wish Phoenix all the luck he can have for upcoming awards season because his turn here can really be described as greatness. There was always a lot of arguing about who's the best Joker. Nicholson? Ledger? Hamill? Romero? There is definitely a new name that can be added to the discussion now. All in all, the film gets a thumbs-up from me."
6,"My immediate reaction coming out of the cinema was that the film would be better suited as a play. This being because in the film there are only really four main settings: the apartment, the city, the subway, and the comedy club/theatre/television studio. Especially with the last setting(s) I mentioned, as a play the various reactions of a live audience could add realism and also an active reciprocal interaction between Arthur and an audience which I think would be more entertaining.I agree with my friend's opinion of the film, for which he believed the range of issues covered was ""as wide as a sea but as deep as a pond"". The main issues such as mental health, misogyny, class, politics, and parental relations (as well as many others) were all raised and recognised as issues but were not explored in any depth, again as my friend put beautifully he believed Phillips was ""tickboxing"" issues that are meaningful to current audiences.When Arthur is sitting alone at the back of the bus, the CGI outside the back window is horrendous. There is also a weird camera shake when Arthur climbs into the fridge, which from the angle makes you think this is from a first-person perspective of an unknown person in Arthur's flat, but then there is a cut and on reflection seems bizarre. Clearly Phillips ran out of budget and had to film on a potato.The musical score was excellent until it was muddled with contemporary music (for example when Arthur dances down the concrete steps) which was a jarring and incongruent.On a more positive note, Phoenix's Joker was original and superbly acted. Arthur having a condition making him laugh creepily and inappropriately was an authentic and believable aspect of his character. Phoenix is very effective at laughing with dead and soulless eyes, making him seem utterly sinister.Similar to Hamlet, The Joker can be played in many different ways because of the ambiguous complexity of his character. Phoenix's Joker is a victim of the worst aspects of society, fragile, and deeply forlorn. This being a very different interpretation to the assertive and more dominant representations in Leto's or Ledger's performances.All in all, a good watch but please someone adapt it into a play!PS: I want that suit."
6,"This movie had a lot of potential. A very suitable actor (Phoenix) for the role as looker seemed perfect, and his acting was fine! But the movie is too damn slow! The directing for this movie was just bad. Also the cliche moment of this movie were to obvious..."
6,"This is a good movie. Dark, tragic and brooding. So many excellent aspects to it. Great acting, sets, costumes. Fantastic score.But...The context is that this is The Joker of Batman Nemeses notoriety. The film just doesn't fit. Arthur is a truly sad and tragic, disturbed and intellectually challenged character. His back story is deeply disturbing and one cannot help but feel sympathy if not empathy. The REAL Joker is not a sad victim. He is a malevolent, intelligent maniac. Not someone you have an ounce of sympathy for.I think this movie fails because of this context. If it was purely a study into the psychological development of a sociopath I think it would be excellent. Sadly it is not. It is the origin story of a comic book baddie. Nothing comic book baddie about this miserable human.There are a few other issues I had with it, there primary one being that he is incapable of coherent speech and social interaction throughout the movie but he suddenly is able to produce a powerful monologue on set in front of a live audience and in front of TV cameras and his former idol. I understand that his confidence grows the less he has to lose but I found this jarring and dissonant.I also found his fantasy relationship silly and then overly ""explained"".That aside, Joachim is phenomenal!! A one man tour de force. Truly believable if not relatable.This is a must see for his performance but I think Batman fans will be disappointed."
6,"Let me start off by saying the cinematography is as good as people say. The acting is also truly impressive and for those that are not into comic book movies this should be a great depiction. But that's also where I find myself wondering how people are even putting Joker into the same ballpark as The Dark Knight. The issue I have is the same issue I had with Suicide Squad. The Joker isn't just an insane man causing chaos as far as he walks. He is calculated and intelligent. Striking the perfect balance between insane and I wonder is it all an act. In this movie I only witnessed an mental disturbed man with pain in is life go off the rails. I never felt he had the capacity to formulate a world ending plot, bit rather just finds himself fortunate to have everything fall in place. Still a great movie,it's just not The Joker."
6,"Beautifully filmed and acted, but not the movie you want to watch twice. Joaquin Phoenix was superb. Like buying a house is location, location, location. Movies are story, story, story. Story was strung along and the Wayne aspect was week. With all the tools that were available, it should have been a better film. It had great potential. Joaquin Phoenix carried the film too much."
6,Everyone should riot and be violent? The actor's skill isn't that great. Just laugh. Anyone can do that. Joker nominated for Academy award is a joke.
6,"Joker could have been a good movie. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job, but in my opinion, the character he is playing is not believable. In a world full of extremes and evil characters (with a very tiny exception, sorry for the bad pun), the Joker's destiny and shattering past are lost in the chaotic, dark environment. His state of mind and supposed mental illness are not further explained. In a more realistic setting (like New York instead of Gotham) this might have been more convincing.Sadly, this Joker is not even the same we see in the Batman movies. No Introduction to the ""why so serious"" slogan we know him for, no explanation for the scar across his face neither. Still the connection to the Waynes is elaborated very much, even though most viewers exactly know what's going to happen to them and therefore eliminates all possible tension.Especially the first hour or so is pretty boring. Some people around me even fell asleep in the cinema, something I have not seen in quite some time in the movies. CGI are well done and unintrusive. I didn't notice them for most parts of the movie (which is good).The Movie tries to be deep, shocking and touching, but is, for me, unrelateable, unbelievable and, yes, pretty boring. The Joker is too cartoonish to be believable, too shallow to be touching. Compared to similarly connected movies like Birdman, it falls short."
6,"Is whatever you want it to be. If you want to hate it, you'll hate it. If you want to love it, you'll love it. Be optimistic."
6,"I used to race cars, still spend a bit of time on the track, so I know this story,
even met some of the actual people involved here (I'm old), and I wanted to really like the movie more than I did. Of course the car porn was fantastic, the casual way in which iconic multi-million dollar cars were placed around the set and even some of the scenes showing the GT40 moving around the airport tarmac were very good. For the latter, they captured speed well here, which is very difficult. So, kudos. But the actual danger involved, although shown to some extent, was not given the attention really needed. I understand the dramatic demands for a movie, but I would think emphasizing the danger would only help. Just to be clear, there were two deaths in a five month period, Miles and Macdonald, although deaths and massive injuries were very common then, these deaths actually had an effect on the racing community. Also, to be clear, the Ford effort was massive, they simply hired the very best in the US to get the GT40 developed. It really was a huge disparity between Ford and any other team. In reality, once Ford got out the kinks, it was a foregone conclusion, no matter that Ferrari made amazing cars. In this regard, little was made of the genius and absolute necessity of Phil Remmington to the entire GT40 project, he was the actual development lead on the car and he was made out to be a Disney -like character, uncle Phil with almost no real role to play. Well, actually, the character of Miles, also an engineer on the project was a compiled character that included ""Rem"" but because Rem was the essential piece for GT40 development, they had to gesture towards him, I suppose. Again, it was an okay movie, very much in the genre, although a bit better acted, Damon and Bale fighting with each other, using food, a thrown wrench, the supportive, loving wife. Within the context of a buddy movie, the movie does work, but its too long and you feel it, although I did like the way Miles death accident was shown, not a lot of buildup, save for the music, and then a highspeed muffled crash, no huge histrionics after and then the both true and movie cliche line ""sometimes they don't come home."" I wanted more of the internal mechanics of that, I wanted more of Henry Ford crying in the car, a great scene, actually because both the absolute insanity of being in a racing car as well as his joy were conveyed, I thought that was a magnificent human moment, unexpected and worth the movie, on it's own."
6,"It is entertaining, its a crowd pleaser, Christian Bale (as always) inhabits the role and Matt Damon is Matt Damon. But this is made to appeal to the widest range of viewers and as such dumbs just about everything down. Its soooo predictable, corny as hell and of course the baddies are so archetypically baddy. There's nothing subtle here, though I did like Marmite product placement."
6,"I must confess that sports car racing is probably at the bottom of my list when it comes to the type of spectator sports I like to watch. Granted, it takes a lot of courage to be a race driver. But why risk your life especially if you're married and have children? (as in the case of one of the protagonists here, Ken Miles, played quite effectively by Christian Bale).
What's more, most of the glory seems to go to the companies that put up the money for these spectacles. So in this case, we're asked to root for the Ford Motor Company with their obnoxious, win-at-all-costs boss, Henry Ford II (Tracie Letts), and his minions, who propose that Ford enter the racing game as a grand marketing promotion opportunity.
In looking at the title of this film, one can get the wrong first impression that the antagonist is Ferrari, the small Italian car manufacturer, known for its output of luxury vehicles as well as success in sports car racing. After Henry Ford attempts to buy Ferrari and is turned down, this is his impetus for getting involved in the racing game. His goal is to develop a new, blazing fast car that can usurp Ferrari's dominant position in winning one prestigious race after another (particularly on the French Le Mans circuit).
Ferrari thus has little screen time after the initial rejection of the Ford buyout. Instead, Ford hires Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) a famous driver forced to retire due to a heart condition, now with an up and coming reputation as a top notch car designer. Shelby, an aggressive straight-shooter, hires the loose cannon Brit, Ken Miles, as his driver and mechanic consultant, just as he's about to lose his auto body shop due to non-payment of taxes.
Meanwhile, Henry Ford appoints Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) as his Senior Vice President in charge of developing the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype, the super car that's ultimately supposed to best Ferrari at Le Mans. Bebbe, a buffoon of a character, becomes the antagonist, when he opposes Shelby and his insistence that Miles take the wheel during the big race. Bebbe can't stomach such a ""politically incorrect"" character as Miles and insists that other drivers test out the new Ford car at the upcoming Le Mans race. Sure enough, Ford ends up losing badly against Ferrari.
A cursory glance of the true history of all these machinations reveals that Beebe's push back against Shelby was exaggerated: the main sticking point in the film is his insistence that Davis not be the appointed driver. Historically, that never happened: the year before success, Davis actually DID race at Le Mans and lost to Ferrari.
There's more standard Hollywood treatment here with the specious suggestion that the development of the GT40 Mk 1 was mainly due to Davis's innate knowledge of car mechanics-there's a scene where Shelby rejects a computer analysis by Ford engineers and trusts Davis, with his more home-grown approach, to fine tune the car. In actuality, the Ford engineers worked in close conjunction with Shelby and Davis, and the ultimate success was truly a team effort.
While Damon's part as Shelby in the first half of the film revolves around defending Miles and convincing Ford that Beebe's approach at micro-managing will not work, in the second half, his role is really reduced to a glorified cheerleader, as Christian Bale ends up with the much juicier part of actually driving the car during the Daytona 500 ""tune-up"" and the ultimate challenge at Le Mans.
All the behind-the-scenes drama ends up as a kind of mixed bag. Shelby trying to rein in the aforementioned ""loose cannon"" Miles can be entertaining but sometimes gets a bit much (especially when Damon and Bale fight like five year olds, tussling on the ground while Miles' wife looks on). Speaking of Miles' wife, Mollie (played by the sultry British actress Caitriona Balfe), she and their young son Peter, have little to do throughout, also often acting as glorified cheerleaders.
The aforementioned behind-the-scenes drama also applies to the goings-on at the Ford Motor Company. There's a good scene where Shelby takes Henry Ford for a test drive which causes him to have an epiphany regarding the danger of driving these type of cars. As a result, Ford entrusts Shelby with calling the shots after the initial loss to Ferrari at Le Mans.
Less successful is the way the scenarists handle Beebe who is reduced to the aforementioned buffoon. I'm thinking especially of that ridiculous scene where Shelby locks Beebe in an office, preventing him from giving orders during one of the critical test races.
Ultimately, a film such as this needs to present a credible and entertaining enough behind-the-scenes drama in addition to its actual racing sequences. On that score, I will reiterate, the Ford v Ferrari ""drama"" is passable, which will hold your interest (not all of it is that ""believable"" however, on the other hand).
The racing scenes (particularly the ones at Le Mans) are particularly well done and the outcome is a bit of a curve ball (SPOILERS: with Ferrari out of the race, Miles, who is way ahead, is ordered to slow down so that all three Ford cars cross the finish line at the same time!).
The film also manages some pathos at the climax, when Miles ends up being killed in a test drive accident two months after his triumph at Le Mans. Racing aficionados will probably dig this wholeheartedly. Much lesser enthusiasts (such as myself) can appreciate the screenwriting effort, despite the Hollywood treatment."
6,A huge disappointment for racing fans ( and who else would watch this sort of film ?). No mention of the original designer of the GT40 Eric Broadley of British car maker Lola on whose GT mk VI the Ford was based. No mention of Denny Hulme who co-drove with Ken Miles. It's as if he didn't exist. WTF ?!The largely hammy acting by Christian Bale also a let down as Miles' brummie accent sounded more like cockney in Bale's portrayal. Really poor dialogue and not even close to the real story. The best thing about the film was the racing machinery used but in the driving sequences a car wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes the way Bale smashed through the gears.Nowhere near the class of the racing classics Grand Prix and Le Mans.
6,"I actually was pretty excited to see this movie. As an athlete myself I must say I usually don't agree with the hollywoodization of sports in general, but with Mangold at the helm and two of the best actors in the business as the main characters I got pretty optimistic.
Needless to say, all three mentioned above do their best, but the writting behind this movie is laughable at best. It tries really hard to be profound, with characters just charghing wrecklesly through the streets to show how pissed of they are, but it never really gets to the level of sentiment you would expect from and oscar nominated movie. I honestly don't know what got that nomination besides the shameless pro-american message.
Ford v Ferrari, which is not even the main thing about this movie, could be easily described like this: take a race car driver and put him in a movie that's not even about racing (it's unlikely it'll be any good). That's about the jist of it, just the other way round.
If you want to make a movie about a sport, just call someone who actually knows that field and listen to them. Sad to say, probably without his fault since it's a nicely passed, good looking movie, this is one of Mangold's misses.
Props to Bale for another great performance. Damon was fine, I guess. Also the movie is way too long at 2h and a half"
6,"Ford v Ferrari is a well-made, well-shot film with some very good acting. It is also an utterly boring, predictable, by-the-numbers sports/competition success story, and that is its damning flaw. The plot contains almost conceivable cliche that can be found in this sort of movie, hitting all the usual story beats. A hastily-assembled crew of outcasts being given a seemingly impossible task against an unbeatable sports rival, dealing with their personal problems and struggling against the interference of smug, suited corporate figures who do not like the fact that our heroes are not types who play by the book, and growing as characters along the way. Directing-wise, this plot comes with all the usual accoutrements, the most obvious of which is montages where the team of underdogs progress in their quest.The result is a movie where one can easily guess all the plot points and how the next scene is going to play out. Even the lighthearted, comedic moments happen exactly the way such scenes happen in every other movie of this kind. All of this especially becomes a problem when it is far longer than it should be. And despite the bloated runtime, some story elements somehow remain underwhelming. We know that the main characters are good friends simply because the script pretty much tells us so, but this is not properly set up. Some of the context and the events that drive the story forward are difficult to figure out, although this may be less so for viewers who are familiar with the racing context and the real-life events. In addition, it is sad that for a movie titled Ford v Ferrari, we never really see the events from the Italians' side, who remain bumbling foes beset by their overconfidence throughout the film.All of this is not the say that the movie is not well-made. It is, despite the obvious CGI-y look of some of the racing scenes, and this is pretty much the reason behind my 6/10 score. If you are a diehard racing fan, or -for whatever reason- have never seen a sports/competition movie of this kind, you might really like it. Otherwise, the redeeming qualities of the picture are not enough to save it from being pretty much a total bore."
6,"The acting crew is absolutely amazing. They delivered stellar performances and brought so much emotion to each character. Besides that I don't understand the hype around this movie. It feels a bit boring and dragged more than once. I felt like pushing myself to watch it until the end just because I started. Maybe If you're a car fan this leaves a different impression, but for me it felt like a movie for passing time and hardly any work of art."
6,"A happy go lucky (aside from the ending) movie about Ken Miles and Carrol Shelby and their quest to make and race a car to beat Ferrari's dynasty at Le Mans.The movie was definitely enjoyable. Great true story, great acting by Damon and Bale and it was brightly shot. The way it was shot actually reminded me a lot of Green Book.I did have some issues with it. I thought the way the story was told was really straight forward and lacked any depth. I would have liked to see more of Ferrari's perspective, I thought Ken Miles family dialogue didn't feel very important to the story, I thought, outside of Tracy Letts, the supporting cast fell way short.So, while it was an easy watch despite its 2.5 hour run time, it lacked depth to bring it from a fun movie to a great movie."
6,"Nothing really surprising or deep here, by the numbers script, showing the all-american cliches: manly American men, each more charismatic and talented than a hundred Italian men, their loving and hot American housewives, great professionals at wonderful Ford, etc. You know: USA Is No. 1. Yaaawn."
6,"If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind. Le Mans '66 requires no prior interest in the sport in the same way that you don't need to be a boxing fanatic to enjoy Rocky. At heart, it's a character piece; a platonic romance between two men best able to express themselves behind the wheel. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon, affable as ever) is a former racerturned-car designer. In the '60s he's hired by Ford to head up the ailing motor company's morale-boosting effort to win the famous 24 Hours Of Le Mans endurance race. And, more specifically, to beat the reigning Ferrari team while doing so.
Shelby brings in his buddy Ken Miles (Christian Bale) not only to help design the vehicle that Ford is betting the farm on, but also to drive it. The aptly named Miles is purely driven by his passion for the automotive arts and an unquenchable need for speed. Wayward Brummie accent aside, it's a lovely, warm performance from Bale. There's the trademark intensity - heightened by his geometrically sharp cheekbones - but here it's in service to a common goal, and a love of the sport. Miles doesn't suffer fools, but there's a sweetness to his family-man side and the sheer thrill he gets from racing, hooting things like ""Giddy-up!"" as he pushes the rev counter to its limit. If Miles is the heart of the team, Shelby's the head, bringing his own racing expertise to bear while also managing the expectations of the suits upstairs, including the irascible Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and smarmy marketing type Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). (There's a barely hidden filmmaking analogy here, as the creative visionaries struggle to keep their ideas on track while placating the needs of the executives.) Throw in Jon Bernthal as another, more amenable, exec and the cast starts to feel a little bloated, especially given that the two-hours-30 runtime is generous for a film on a largely predictable track. Bernthal's good, but did we really need another middle-man in the mix, given that Shelby already occupies that negotiator role?
Le Mans '66 truly roars into life during the racing scenes, particularly the final act show-stopper. The visceral, pulsequickening laps instantly join the canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen that there's never a palpable sense of a head-to-head rivalry. In their minimal screentime, the Italians come across as scowling stereotypes. And on the subject of stereotypes, Outlander's Caitriona Balfe is lumbered with a limited supportive-wife role as Mollie Miles. It's clear she knows her way around an engine, but she's rarely required to do more that squint with concern at a radio while her husband races. The family scenes don't quite get under the skin of Miles' compulsions in the way that First Man explored the more selfish aspects of Neil Armstrong's pursuits. It's on the physical side that Le Mans '66 really delivers - not only in the aforementioned races, but in the lo-fi mechanics, and the pit stops that canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen take an eternity in comparison to modern-day refuelling methods. The film is a visual treat, an expertly crafted piece of sun-burnished Americana, with no shortage of big-screen thrills. Mangold's career to date has seen a mix of straightforward blockbusters (Knight And Day, The Wolverine) and character pieces (Girl, Interrupted, Cop Land, Walk The Line) but, for all its strengths, Le Mans '66 doesn't straddle that divide as effectively as Mangold's last film, Logan, did."
6,"Ford v Ferrari sees Christian Bale channeling his inner Nigel Mansell. He plays the racer Ken Mills, a war hero from Sutton Coldfield who became a maverick race driver for the fledgeling Ford racing team.Mills is recruited by former racer turned car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) who has been hired by the Ford Motor Company to turn around the company's fortunes by making their cars look hip. To do this they are going to knock Ferrari off their perch and win the Le Mans 24 hours race.Of course it is odd to see Ford, a corporate Goliath to be cast as the underdog here. The racing division is championed by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) but the fly in the ointment is Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) a square peg in a round hole.In their sights is Ferrari, who themselves are struggling financially and have the temerity to object to being bought out by Ford. In retaliation Ford develop a racing car at a super speed with Miles testing it.Ford v Ferrari is an enjoyable if overlong melodrama, the Le Mans race scenes are done very well. I did find the portrayal of Beebe as the token villain to be facile. He was there to give the film unnecessary tension.The best performance is from Bale who leaves Damon behind."
6,"The challenge of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which gets reduced to an unparsimonious Two Hours and 32 Minutes of Le Movie, is that you have to go fast, really fast, as fast as you can and for 24 hours on an uneven, treacherous track, sometimes at night, sometimes in the rain, all while not destroying the automobile itself, and also not the drivers. Occasionally, you become One with Le Car, somewhere right around 7,000rpm, and you either ascend into pure energy, or you blow a rod shifting into a bonus gear.There are a few chances for Ford v Ferrari to be a more socially meaningful film, maybe more openings for more clever statements about the stuffiness of businessmen and suited executives versus the life-loving, individualistic visionaries who make the businessmen jealous because they do not have the creativity or talent to do much beyond monetizing other people's excellences. On the other hand, the movie does a good job of instilling the adrenaline rush of setting new lap records, none of which feels very safe.If we all were to make a list of stuff to do for exactly 24 hours, speed racing is not likely to appear on many of our lists. Thankfully, most activities can be achieved in under three hours."
6,"This is not about Ford vs Ferrari. This is not about 24h Le Mans. This is about Shelby and Miles, dramatized Hollywood style."
6,Not worth watching. Its exceedingly long for a movie composed entirely by stereotypes and american clichés. Some of the acting is good but it does not make up for the rest of the movie. Very commercial and not so entretaining.
6,"Good racing scenes, ruined by flat characters (what was the point of Miles's wife being there) and a terrible hamming up by Christian Bale, apparently using his own English accent, but managing to make himself sound like Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Very sexist too."
6,"There's nothing really new here, a pretty safe sports biopic like you're used to seeing, but this one still manages to milk the formulaic into something at times engaging, even while it's familiar. If nothing else, at least it's pretty damn good-looking and the racing scenes are shot and edited in a pretty high-octane way. Apart from that, it's cozily predictable (compulsory oft-repeated family melodrama and all), whether you know the history or not, but mercifully not in an enraging way like most movies of this type. A passable companion piece to Ron Howard's 'Rush'. I give it 5.5/10."
6,"Christian Bale continues to prove that he is one of the best actors of this era, and this film is another example of it. Damon is good, but Bale carries this film much like his character carries his racing team. The story is very interesting, maybe better titled ""Shelby v. Ford"" rather than ""Ford v. Ferrari"" but a story worth hearing about, especially if you are not familiar with it already. It definitely consists of some run of the mill and cliche sport biopic moments and themes but it is worth checking out for the performances, direction and if you're into sports, cars and races.Mitchell Bulfin"
6,"Le Mans '66 is a fun movie despite having an overly dramatized plot. In a way this is your usual Hollywood action/drama flick with little to no regard to respecting how events originally occurred. Lifting inspiration from incidents happening around its main people - Miles and Shelby - and integrating them into their story making it more thrilling but also less believable. Ken Miles' life had enough for a whole movie but they rather incorporated made-up drama than telling about his war experience or perhaps showing that the other drivers are not just there as simple antagonists. The handling of the 'Ferrari deal' is also laughable, distorting history for the sake of extra drama. I am the first to point out that Le Mans - the '71 movie - was a kind of special something, going to the extreme with its focus on motorsport while FvF went to the other extreme where human drama is the most important and the writers did not hesitate to alter facts and sacrifice character integrity in order to serve a thrilling story. In my book this is an inferior attempt at a historic biography/racing film."
6,Well F v F is better than 1917 or Parasite but it's still a very ordinary movie. Worth watching but worthy of no awards. What a poor year for the film industry.
6,"For what it was, well done, but didn't have much drama, excitement, or emotion and there is two and a half hours of it.I'm well versed in the story having and viewed material about it many times over the years.Was worth a watch but can't recommend it for your average viewer. There's just not enough there for your average viewer. If your a car person, specifically car history it's possibly more your speed.I've fallowed Ferrari and the GT40 as far as Ford is concerned; but I'll probably never watch this one again.Good n then for getting it make but there's not much here for most people."
6,"ALMOST everything about this movie was so good. The acting, the dialogue, the sound design, the cars! It also just looks so beautiful. Whatever is shown on screen matches with the tone at all times, and the colours are gorgeous throughout. The sound track was also really good, especially during the race, and the race scenese had clutching my palms the entire time.The thing is, though, the story is just so weak! To me, the ending is just super depressing without reason. A tragic ending like that should feel deserved, but it didn't. If the movie ended with Miles losing first place, it would been a bittersweet ending, but I felt like they had to just shove his death in there. (Why is there a major plot point in the falling action?) I usually get so emotional during movies, but I literally felt nothing here.They changed the story so much already, couldn't they have just changed it a lil' more to make narrative sense? I really wanted to like it because I'm such a big fan of the actors, but the more I thought about the story, the less sense it made to me."
6,"All the aspects of the movie are very well done: Photography, directing, acting, the plot,... However, the theme of the movie is not interesting enough so it remains irrelevant"
6,"6/10 - maybe there was just too much hype for it or I just didn't feel a connection to any of the characters, but this one failed to hold my undivided attention for its lengthy duration"
6,"The driving scenes aren't any better or more realistic than the foolishness in the fast and furious movies. You can't yell at other drivers, and everyone is trying to ""out brake"" (what they mean is ""brake later than"") everyone else on every turn. That's just part of driving a good lap. More time on the throttle and less time on the brakes means a faster lap.The movie is stylish, good clothes, cool music, but there's a perfectly good documentary about the same events called ""The 24-Hour War."" All those people they talk about in this movie are actually IN the documentary. It's on Netflix. Hell, I had dinner with David Hobbs at the Chattanooga Motor Car Festival last fall, and I also saw Bill Elliott there. Those are real people who really risked their lives for the love of racing, not some actors playing at it.If you prefer to see the Hollywood version of the world, that's your decision. But I prefer real life or real fiction. This ""biopic"" nonsense is merely the appearance of art depicting the appearance of reality. Some would say the shadows of reality seen on the wall of a cave. I love a good story as much as the next guy, but if it's real, I'd like to hear it from the guys who lived it, not someone (like me) who only wished he'd lived it."
6,Story was really good but the editing and scenes seemed out of place. The background music was horrible.
7,"The Fast and the Furious series consist of 7 movies soon to be 8, starring The Rock-Dwayne Johnson in the last 3 movies, Vin Diesel- The voice of Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy, and the late Paul Walker who has been in many action movies, along with Gal Gadot who is set to play Wonder Woman in the line of DC comics movies unfortunately Gal Gadot's character Chazelle died in Fast and Furious 6 , Michelle Rodriguez, Tyreese Gibson from Transformers, Ludicrous is a musician as well as an actor, Jordana Brewster and the antagonist is Deckard Shaw played by Jason Statham who has been in one million and one action movies. For those who have seen Fast and Furious 6 the perpetrator of those events is Owen Shaw played by Luke Evans who is in Immortals, The Hobbit the Desolation of Smaug, The Battle of the Armies, Deckard is Owen's older brother out for revenge, because Dominic Torreto's (Vin Diesel) team put Owen in the hospital. Fast and Furious 7 is packed full of action stunts that are bigger than the last movie, that take you to multiple countries all around the world, America, Abu Dhabi, Canada and multiple locations in USA. After Deckard Shaw is placed in solitary confinement in one of the most secure facilities, the team are on a beach with all their new cars lined up behind them, because of Paul Walker's death, the makers of the movie changed the ending. Dominic knows Brian O Conner (Paul Walker) doesn't belong with him anymore because he has a wife, one child and another on the way. Dominic drives off and leaves Brian behind, you see him in his car driving off into the distance when Brian now played by Paul's brother Cody Walker and some added effects, Brian says ""You thought you could leave without saying goodbye"". Dom smiles then they go their separate ways when the road forks. This ending wasn't just about Dom saying goodbye to Brian, it was about Vin saying goodbye to Paul, then the credits open with ' See you again' by Charlie Puth and Wiz Kalihifa, this song is a tribute to Paul Walker."
7,"Furious 7 is badass. This movie is way different than the previous installments, due to James Wan, who was a fantastic director and had great camera shots in this. The fight scenes were awesome,the Statham and Rock fight is one of the best in the whole series. The audience was cheering and clapping through the whole film. The movie was also hilarious due to the comedic sides of Tyrese and Ludicrous. It was interesting to see how they dealt with Paul Walker,the CGI could've been better but I loved the way they used archive footage of him.Along with the action, there is a very emotional side to this movie. There are certain scenes that are very sad and one of them,Paul actually filmed. Overall,this movie was packed with tons of action,badass one-liners,and a farewell to an amazing actor and person. Rest in Peace Paul Walker."
7,"I am well aware that this series has always been about big sequences and loud entertainment, some best cars are used but i know about the upcoming car movies which used in http://www.gari.pk/new- cars/toyota/mark-x but this was just too damn stupid. Not a scene went by that something completely implausible happened. And the acting."
7,"With silly and crazy action pieces (some of them, way overlong, particularly in the last third), over the top and sanitized violence, so much testosterone it is pouring out of the screen, and with characters that are, basically, immortal, ""Furious 7"" is also mysteriously hypnotizing, and, even if not particularly original. Family will always be family.A blast. With a touching coda."
7,"I went to a midnight screening yesterday and everyone in the theater seemed to have a great time. The highlight was undoubtedly the parachuting-scene that is extensively featured in the trailers. It is the most ridiculous and arguably the best action set piece in the entire series, narrowly beating out the bank vault chase from Fast five.Unfortunately, the film fails to achieve that same level of excitement again. The big action scene at the end is quite unimaginative for a fast&furious-movie and goes on for way too long. Over-reliance on CGI also hurts the movie, since it's not always completely convincing.Most of you will know that some of Paul Walkers scenes were made using his brothers as stand-ins combined with CGI. I'm glad to say they completely pulled it off. I personally never noticed anything off about Brian in the movie. I'm not going to spoil how Brian's journey ends, but I can say that it's a fitting and respectful goodbye to both Walker and his character of Brian. It gets really emotional."
7,"Doesn't Dominic Toretto drive off and leave Letty at the end??? considering all the 'family' stuff in the film, seems... well... weird!"
7,"I know the Furious films are over the top by nature, but after the 5th film, they started becoming downright impossible to believe. However, that's part of the appeal I suppose, to watch something that could never happen in real life. Number 7 is a decent flick, and I don't have too many complaints. I'd say my biggest gripe is with Tyrese Gibson's character, Roman. Why is he even in these films? I know he's supposed to be the comic relief, but honestly, do you think a professional team would keep a guy that does nothing but whine and complain, and can't even offer any benefit to the team besides being an annoying, loud-mouthed braggart? It's silly to think that above everything, high flying stunts included, that's the part that's hardest to believe for me.RIP Paul Walker. Not the greatest actor out there, but I really did like his character in these movies, and he seemed like a good guy in real life. The Furious movies will not be the same without him."
7,This was gonna be the best fast and the furious but they ruined everything at the end
7,"Furious 7 is a solid entry in the Fast and Furious franchise but it's, by no means, spectacular. I know you shouldn't expect too much from one of these movies, but, while, I liked and had fun with the film, I still think it's not on the same tear as the previous two movies. This is now the highest-rated movie of the franchise on Rotten Tomatoes and I don't think it warrants that. While I can definitely say I enjoyed this more than the first four installments I think it not as good as Fast Five or Six. The story has two main faults that put it bellow those films for me.The film does many things right. It is a lot of fun despite by grips with it. Vin Diesel and the rest (for the most part) reprise their roles here and they do a pretty good job. The effects, like in the last two films are very well-done as well.I also love what they did in the end. I loved the tribute to Paul Walker at the very end. It was sweet and served as a nice send-off too him. I'm glad he went out on a fairly high note. I didn't even notice it was his brother doing many of Paul's scenes. Whether it was the effects or the way it was shot, they did a good job in that regard.The action is a lot of fun as insane as it is. I warn you will have to suspend your disbelief immensely to enjoy the action here. This took the over-the-top nature that the previous films had and intensified it to the tenth power. The action seems to get crazier with each film. However, despite it was still highly entertaining. This film might have the most and greatest action scenes of all the movies; even Fast Six.However, as I stated before I have two major problems. One is that the film seems very unfocused. The previous films all had a simple structure and a basic singular goal. In this movie it starts out with Jason Statham's character hunting Toretto and the group. However, then it shifts to this completely out-of-nowhere plotline regarding the God's Eye and Djimon's character for the entire middle portion and Statham gets put on the backburner. Statham occasionally shows-up to remind us he's in the movie but not much focus is given to him.Statham should have been the main villain and focus. He's the more interesting villain and one presenting the most personal conflict for the heroes. It's like they needed this other plot just to give the rest of the cast something to do and to show more over-the-top fights. Instead he's played as more of an afterthought for most of it which is my second big problem. Also the way he gets beaten is extremely underwhelming as well. Kurt Russell is there but he doesn't get to do much either. That is more of a minor grip but it irked me.Overall, Furious 7 is an entertaining film with some great action. If you like Vin Diesel and the rest of the Fast crew (except Han) you won't be disappointed. I don't think it's as good as the previous few installments but still found it serviceable and a good send-off for Walker. If you like this series then check this out."
7,"This episode can be called Speed and Building Demolition ~From the beginning, it can not help but reveal the flavor of commemoration. Through diesel's monologue at the end of the episode, it separates from the fork road, and ""a paul"" appears on the screen and rises to the top. Looking at the blonde handsome man in the collection, I can't help feeling that things are human and non-business."
7,"Furious 7 is surprisingly entertaining. It's like this movie has accepted what it is, so the acting is hilariously melodramatic and the action sequences are unapologetically over-the-top. And then the ending turns into a touching tribute to the late Paul Walker. I'm still not a fan of the franchise, but this movie is one of the few that is worth a watch."
7,"Furious 7: Movie Review.Furious 7 is a film with little bit taste and touch of Humor and it is also sad and emotional too at the same time. Some Action Sequences are good and well executed. James Wan Direction is good.The fight sequences of the movie are well directed as well as well performed. The performances are enjoyable. Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Kurt Russel, along with rest of the cast are amazing in their respective characters. Story is not so great but visually its thrilling till the end. As for Paul Walker and his performance, he is charming as ever. It makes me sad and emotional that I have watched a last performance by him. It makes me emotional to say that this film marks the final appearance of one of my most favorite character of this series, Paul Walker. His performance in the movie is above all and its emotionally touching. The Tribute and Honor to him at the end of the movie is very emotional and touching and very well directed to say goodbye and farewell to one of the legendary character of the Furious series- Paul Walker- Brain O' Connor.Fast and Furious will Never going to be the same.--For Paul---Thank you Paul Walker for Entertaining Me. You Will be always in my heart and in my memories. You will always going to be one of my most favorite character in Fast and Furious films for all time. Furious 7 is the movie which always going to be close to my heart because of Paul Walker.All over, Furious 7 is a good movie. It's Fun, Entertaining, Action Packed and Emotional Ride.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."
7,"Directed by James WanStarring Vin Disel, Paul Walker and Jason StathamPlot Overview: ​Soon after his brother was crippled by Dominic Torretto(Vin Disel)'s crew, Deckard Shaw(Jason Statham) seeks revenge and tries to seek out those who harmed his brother.This movie is not only a powerful tribute to the guy who started this entire franchise, but is also an immensely enjoyable popcorn flick that succeeds without the burden of handling Paul Walker's death. I applaud James Wan and the rest of the crew for managing to make a movie incredibly enjoyable yet also incredibly upsetting. Wan had the burden of making a standard F&F popcorn flick but on top of that saying farewell to Paul and he did it in such a beautiful way that he must be applauded for that. Even without the heartbreaking tribute at the end, this movie stands on its own two feet as an immensely enjoyable popcorn flick and could have ended the franchise in the best way possible.Half of this story was a by the numbers revenge story about Deckard Shaw(Jason Statham) hunting down those who crippled his brother. While this arc was done pretty well, it pales in comparison to the other half of the movie which was attempting to bid farewell to Brian O'Connor/Paul Walker. I think that this half of the movie was flawless and really pulled at your heartstrings. The ending was also incredible and genuinely heartbreaking which is the first time a movie like that has drawn genuine emotion from me. It was(and should have been) the perfect way to end this franchise. Alas they didn't end it here but that is another matter entirely.It's very hard to comment on what was Paul Walker and what wasn't but regardless the character of Brian O'Connor was played very well and you could really feel emotion conveyed through it. Vin Disel was alright as Dominic Torretto but I think that the emotion he emitted was genuine which is actually heartbreaking, and I don't want to even think about going through that, but it doesn't necessarily prove his worth as an actor. Jason Statham is the the God of War incarnated. He is a living metaphor for badass and he really shines in this movie. That said, I think they could have done so much more with his character. Granted, Deckard Shaw was easily the best villain this franchise has ever had but I think they built him up to be this unstoppable force but then he only had one or two scenes that were genuinely noteworthy. Another great thing is that every character's actions is in someway justified. Vin Disel has Han's death to motivate him and Jason Statham has Owen Shaw's disability to do so. Aside from the main actors, everyone else does fine from Michelle Rodriguez to Kurt Russell but none of them really stood out. I would also have liked to see a LOT more Hobbs because he was the reason this franchise became what it is today.From a technical standpoint, this movie is pretty good. The cinematography is pretty nice and it looks very good. Some of the effects(such as the Dubai sequence) looked awesome whereas others(such as the house sequence) looked unbelievably fake and awful.As far as I'm concerned, this movie needed to provide fun action sequences and bid farewell to Paul Walker in a powerful way. This movie achieved both. They handled each aspect of it so magnificently and beautifully that it was just a treat to watch. 'When I see you again' is an amazing, heart wrenching song that I wholeheartedly believe should have won the Oscar. As a side note(and if you haven't watch the movie you should stop reading now), I would have made one alteration to the end of this movie. In the scene where Brian and Dom and driving down the road as a tribute to Paul Walker, I would have liked them to have both the characters be driving the cars they drove at the end of 'The Fast and the Furious'. If you can't remember them cars, then here is a link http://img1.rnkr-static.com/list_img_v2/192/280192/870/the-fast-and- the-furious-cars-u4.jpg . While it may not have need to happen, I think that doing that would have been a beautiful send off to Paul Walker and would have ended the franchise in a flawless manner.In conclusion, this movie is a very enjoyable popcorn flick that also has a powerful tribute and message so I do recommend that you see it.7/10Would Recommend"
7,"After Paul Walker tragically died, I had wondered how this film would get made. I worried about it being canceled completely, but it didn't and it was gracefully executed. I had one simple problem with the film: Very little Dwayne Johnson. I felt like it'd be even more fantastic with more of Hobbs, Johnson is full of life with his jokes, physicality and personality. The action is amazing, yet it being insanely over the top, which makes it even better because it knows what it is. James Wan, usually known for his chilling and suspenseful horror films did an excellent job with taking over the franchise. Seeing the crew together always makes me smile because the chemistry between them all is wonderful to watch. They are like a real family and you can see it in the last scene. The final scene was truly touching, seeing Brian(Walker) pull up next to Dom(Vin Diesel) and saying ""Are you gonna leave without saying goodbye?"". Seeing them smile at each other and then drive down the road together, honestly brought me to tears. ""He will always be with me. He will always be my brother..""."
7,"The Fast and Furious franchise is one that you cannot review objectively and in a serious manner. The films defy logic, reason and realism. It's a great job that they are damn entertaining then. The franchise never found its steering until 2011's 'Fast Five'. Strange that it has taken them five attempts to get it right. But with this, the seventh instalment they perfect it. The series has not changed so much, if anything it has gotten louder, dumber and more in your face than ever before. The creators realised that the plot is unimportant, what the audience values is inspired set pieces that go against the laws of physics, fast cars, and hot women and now it seems, characters that we very much care about. 'Fast and Furious 7' is a success that I am sure will qualify as the most outrageously entertaining film of the year.As soon as 'Fast and Furious 7' revs up its engine, it never stalls. This instalment begins right after the events of 'Fast and Furious 6' and 'Tokyo Drift', where Hans was killed by Deckard Shaw. He introduces himself through the immortal lines ""Dominic Toretto. You don't know me, but you're about to"". Deckard is after the crew who hospitalised his brother Owen and left him comatose in the previous film. Toretto played by the grizzly Vin Diesel, assembles his crew made up of Brian O'Connor (the likable Paul Walker in sadly his last film role), Letty (the feisty Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (a funny Tyrese Gibson), Tej (a bubbly Ludicrous) and Hobbs (the exhilarating Dwayne Johnson.) They are asked by a character that only refers to himself as Mr Nobody (an engaging Kurt Russell) to retrieve a device known as the God's Eye. It has the ability to track down anyone on the planet anywhere, within hours. The team need this device to find Deckard Shaw before he causes further devastating, destruction in his wake. But this hardly seems necessary as wherever the crew goes Shaw follows swiftly behind. Of course, it is a plot device with little importance to the overall arch of the story; it's only purpose to loosely connect a plot and allow for the madness and mayhem to unfold before our unbelieving eyes.In the first of many (Fast and Furious) set pieces we see Hobbs up against Deckard Shaw. Jason Statham does so well as the villain that it makes you wonder why he has been cast as a hero of a story so many times before. The action is very different and James Wan's technique is more frenetic, less polished and very gritty as opposed to Justin Lin's stylish approach. Even fans of 'The Bourne Trilogy' and the work of Paul Greengrass will have to hold onto their seat for dear life. Thankfully, it is always cohesive, just don't blink. The camera follows the movements of characters with ease and makes these fights far more entertaining than they have any right to be.Some may be disappointed by Dwayne Johnson's absence from the film for the most part. As he only appears at the start and the very end of the film. This however did not detract from the overall experience, as the scenes he does get are undoubtedly some of the craziest, insane and best for his character. So for me it did not matter in the slightest. If anything, it was a good thing as it allowed for more comradery between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, reminding the audience that best friends are for life and your loved ones never truly leave you. Later in the film, Brian O'Connor tells Dominic Toretto that ""cars don't fly"". Toretto stares at him in a disapproving manner and proceeds to crash a Billionaire's Sports Car through two or more skyscrapers. Don't ask why. It does not even matter. You are so caught up in the moment that you forget plausibility.The dialogue in the film always allows for the characters to connect in many different ways be it; serious, funny and even (whisper it) deeply moving. Roman and Tej have no shortage of playful banter. Brian O'Connor and his wife Mia (a spectacular Jordana Brewster) convey emotion, depth and meaningful moments. They don't feel cheesy, even when they discuss the importance of friendship and family. Thank goodness, the director and the screenwriter got this right. Paul Walker's scenes with Vin Diesel boast the best connection between two characters in a very long time indeed. You are never left in any doubt that they were best friends in front of the camera and behind it as well.I have never heard of a film having two Directors of Photography, but 'Fast and Furious 7' does. The film is so staggeringly beautiful that I do not think one cinematographer would be able to convey such a high level of beauty in the exotic locales. The score by Brian Tyler gets the adrenaline pumping and the tear ducts flowing. Especially in the meaningful and moving 'See You Again' by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth, what a beautiful tribute to Paul Walker, even listening to it now, I cannot stop crying. Who knew a film about cars and heists could be so powerful and tear jerking.'Fast and Furious 7' is by far the best instalment in the series. No small feat, when up against the fifth and sixth entries. The action is awesome, the stunts gravity defying and the cast pitch perfect. The script is great, the characters well developed and Paul Walker's send-off makes 'Fast and Furious 7' the most beautiful, poetic and emotional film I have seen in my life. I have no hesitation in stating that 'Fast and Furious 7' is perfect summer blockbuster entertainment and a masterpiece. So strap yourself in for the best ride yet. Rest in Peace Paul Walker. You would be Proud."
7,"This is one of the better movies in the Franchise. To me, it was more emotional than any of the other Fast and Furious movies because this is the last time we will ever see Paul Walker on the big screen. But to me, it was also a really cool and slick movie. The action was awesome, the explosions were timed well. It had a surprising amount of heart, and the characters were built up just enough to make a ridiculous ending seem not so ridiculous. It wasn't a prestigious film with incredible performances, but Vin Diesel and Jason Statham do a good job with their roles. If your looking for something to entertain and thrill, this is the movie for you. It's got cool cars, lots of muscle, and just enough sentiment to keep it human. I say give it a shot."
7,"I consider myself to be a true fan of the ""Fast and Furious"" series. I acknowledge that Tokyo Drift is the worst of them, I myself don't like it, and I also am not the biggest fan of the fourth movie, but for the rest I have always liked if not loved the series. Being 19 years old I kind of grew up with it and have seen it evolved, it has been one of my childhood action franchises just as an 80s kid, looking back now, would consider his Die Hards and Lethal Weapons. I have always had an affection towards the movies, I understand they are not Citizen Kane, but I am truly in love with their riveting and exhilarating sense of fun, that probably no other saga can match, and the characters which I always look forward to hang out another time. Five and Six took both of these elements to the next level and still to this day, I consider some of the staple modern action movies, add this to the fact that I always have been a big Paul Walker fan, ever since I was a kid I thought that he should have been an A-list star, and you can understand the excitement I had for this movie. So after that long introduction, the big question, does the film actually match my excitement? I'll tell you what it exceeds it and takes action film limits to an even further level, even though I may still think Six is still my favourite.Before starting the actual review I want to praise this franchise for how much it has evolved and with the evolution has made every film count more. Now the first Fast and Furious isn't just a street racing movie, but it is seen as the start of this big adventure that takes us to places we would have never imagined with such a sense of fun and self conscious no other action franchise has ever matched. I just want to get the negatives about of the way, because yes I have to acknowledge them, but I would just like to geek out and write a love letter to the Fast and Furious franchise. The cringe-worthy scenes still remain, the storytelling is logically fragile and it does go totally bonkers in the last five minutes of the third act. But you know what? I did not care that much. I already hear the voices of people judging me for giving such high praise to this franchise. You know, I get it if you didn't like the first four movies, I get it, but really just open your dam mind from and have some fun! There is no place on earth where you will find better crafted entertainment, action is an art and boy do these filmmakers excel at it. It doesn't hold up as well as the others upon further viewings because it really does almost go too over the top, but it manages to walk that fine line almost perfectly for it to be still a blast on re-watch.From second one, I was jumping in my seat with joy, I was gasping trying to catch my breath, I felt like I was floating with laughter, this is how much fun is this movie. It is a two hour rush of adrenaline. Scene after scene you're thinking how the hell are they going to top that? And they do! There are sequences in this film that impacted me physically. I can't give the director, the stunts, the DPs, everybody enough credit. It really felt like the best action a human could ask for. As I said before, the movie stumbles here and there with some too over the top stuff or some rare times the scenes feel like filler, but you don't even have time to realize it that we already are at the next breath taking set piece. Credit also goes to the cast as always, who makes it even the more fun. There chemistry is stunning and they even bring the right amount of heart for someone like me who actually cares about them.Now, to the big elephant in the room, how did they handle the death of Paul Walker? I personally think even the greatest minds on earth would have a hard time topping this. From a technical point of view I was always searching for the moment were it would pop on screen and it never came, it's flawless. Moreover, they gave the character such an emotionally correct farewell I had to shed a tear. It was really, really touching. Props to everybody involved, they handled this in the best way and in this occasion I too would like to say goodbye to the actor Paul Walker in his final film. Thanks for your contribution to this amazing action franchise, I can't believe how touching it was for me realizing how many time I had actually passed with you in your films. That ending was such an emotional punch! Go see this movie and have a blast, if you're being sniffy about it either continue living in your ignorance or open your mind and go have the best fun ever!"
7,"Fast & Furious 7 (aka Furious 7) is every bit as fast and furious as some of the franchise's previous installments, if not more. Fast & Furious 7 showcases adrenaline pumping action from start to finish with Vin Diesel once again leading the juggernaut as the macho anti-hero Dominic Toretto. From LA to Tokyo to Azerbaijan to Abu Dhabi, the movie is high octane and absolute carnage and it features some of the coolest heart-stopping fight as well as chase sequences seen in recent times.If you are excited by fast cars, hot chicks, badass dudes, and exotic locations then Fast & Furious 7 would certainly impress you. Like with most action movies, the plot is secondary and what happens is of little consequence vis-a-vis how it happens. While the heroes are larger than life and the villains don't get any meaner than this. Jason Statham is a great addition to the franchise and his presence as the story's antagonist immensely adds to the thrill and excitement.In Fast & Furious 7, Paul Walker is quite impressive in sadly what is his last screen appearance. He will certainly be missed. Michelle Rodriguez is kickass as ever as Toretto's love interest Letty; the chemistry between Rodriguez and Diesel is electrifying. In one of the movie's most scintillating fighting sequences, Rodriguez battles the American mixed martial artist and judoka Ronda Rousey. The raw intensity of the entire scene (given that Rodriguez herself is a trained boxer) makes it absolutely breathtaking to behold.Although, he gets less screen time than usual, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson makes his presence felt in Fast & Furious 7 (all thanks to his hulky physique and great comic timing). Another actor who deserves a special mention is Kurt Russell who is easily the movie's biggest surprise package and an absolute treat to watch. It's a role that can be seen as a tribute to some of Russell's memorable performances in the Action flicks of the '80s, particularly the movies directed by John Carpenter. The supporting cast is solid as ever.While the action can be nonsensical at times, it is great fun to see men fight like machines, and at the end of the day we can't really complain. Can we? Well, who can nitpick at the sight of a sports car jumping from one skyscraper to another? Who can be bored by the sight of a half-a-dozen cars getting jettisoned from an airplane? Who can be turned off by the sight of two alpha males beating the hell out of each other in a street fight of sorts? The bottom line is that Fast & Furious 7 is supposed to be an Action feast and action is what it exactly delivers. It is a very strong contender to be adjudicated as the best film of the franchise, thus far. Fortunately, the action never gets to the point of being obnoxious like so often the case with the films from the Transformer series. Fast & Furious 7 is the perfect Summer Blockbuster from Hollywood; the movie has set the benchmark for the upcoming Action films this summer. The movie's greatest USP is that it is exactly what it is supposed to be, no less or no more.(This review was first published in my film blog A Potpourri of Vestiges)"
7,"This is just a fun movie that in many ways hearkens back to the action movies of the 1980's, just fun senseless destruction with some story-telling. Jason Statham was a phenomenal bad guy. Vin Diesel and crew do a great job creating mayhem across the globe. No reason to think hard for this movie, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Nothing spectacular, very similar to a Trnsporter or XXX type movie. Crowds should not go in expecting a masterpiece, but rather a fun 2 hrs of destruction and fun. The Rock plays his normal jock self and you can see some nice nods to Terminator series at points. Acting and speaking is not very good but there are some funny lines and the tribute to Paul Walker was very nice to see."
7,"1. If you are too young to have seen Kurt Russell in SOLDIER, stop reading this review and go get a copy. I would hate for you to walk away with the impression that Russell (who was a Disney kid in the 1950s) is just a older guy in a suit who plays a smart-talking Fed. Just see it. Thank me later.2. This is more than a ""dream team"" cast. This is so ""high concept"" you could get the bends trying to wrap your head around the strings that were pulled to force this into blockbuster mode. I am sorta OK with that but I want to go on record with the simple observation that the earlier entries in the series did not need to rely on pedigree, or genre-bending, they simply had to rely on what they offered the viewer. There is a difference.3. Quick nod to Statham for creating one of the most iconic characters in modern film. And I am not sure he knows it. If you are fan of BANSHEE (and you should be, it's the edgiest show on TV) they actually had an episode where a Statham clone (a thin killer in a suit with a Brit accent) shows up to fight the sheriff. (OK to stop the review here and go watch Banshee). It was brilliant. Actually pound for pound and word for word and scene for scene better written and directed than this film.4. No car stuff till the 26 min mark? Talk about resting on your laurels? 5. It is one of the better films this year. Problem is, I am not sure that is high praise."
7,"I found myself doing just what everyone else was doing, trying to find where they kill Paul off and where doubles and CGI took-over. Quit that. Later after thinking about the movie itself, I found that this turned into a send-off for him, not really a good movie to stand on it's own. If he hadn't died and I watched this as it was I think I would probably be rating it far less than I did. Plot was at best= so-so, acting was okay but the team design and pull through that had worked in at least the last couple movies wasn't there, they tried but it was figurehead at best. It turned into a 'Vin Diesil's tribute to Paul and I walked out thinking if it wasn't for Paul death I would have felt cheated to have paid to see that."
7,"**Note** This review contains SPOILERS THROUGHOUTSaw this last night (April 3rd). I am a fan of the Furious series and I have seen all of them. I've always loved the cast and especially Paul Walker. Someone noted that this film is not likely to connect with viewers who are not fans of the series or have not followed it and I agree. While I enjoyed the film, it was an awful lot of loudness, explosions, car chases and just beyond unbelievable stunts along with cast members' characters surviving many car stunts and crashes that would have been highly improbable, enough to put Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner to shame. It could have used more character development and more fleshed out villains and it went ON, like a long time. I would like to have had more of Dwayne Johnson's character—he was funny and they gave him a cute daughter in the film. Director Wan does keep the action up though and it is rarely boring. It's important to remember, this is not the film they set out to make. Had Walker lived, it would have been a different film, plot and otherwise. Visually, I did not notice the places where they used CGI with the exception of the fight in the tour bus. There were many quick cuts and it did not look like it was actually Walker tangling with the other man. That scene for me was the best, with the bus dangling over a cliff and Brian scrambling to get out. Even when you know it's not real, it looks so real, very convincing. Letty arrives just in time to save him. Overall, I had a hard time telling when it was Walker's actual scene he was present for and not. The tip-off however to me was various scenes where Walker was present and you expected him to say something but he didn't. Those are the scenes where I believe it was not he. The film begins touchingly enough and funny, where Walker's character is in close-up, grasping a steering wheel and you think it's another racecar and instead he's parking his SUV to get his toddler out. A real change from the early days. There is also a good amount of good-natured banter between the various characters and humorous zingers that made me laugh. It is touching because you know they were all friends on the set and they loved Paul. Another scene with Letty all dolled up in a red dress and makeup was a lot of fun, where she does some kung fu moves in a penthouse suite with some mean bitches (can I say that?) at the Abu Dhabi tower they're at. There is something missing however and you do see it. You can tell there's a certain emotional component that is missing. There are scenes that are just obvious, ""Brian"" would have been saying something or doing something, interacting more but he doesn't. There is only so much you can do with a missing cast member. ""Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee"" John Donne 1572-1631This is ultimately the cast and crew's farewell love letter to Paul Walker and in that they very much succeeded. Walker died on my birthday. I had been out that evening with family and friends only to come home, turn on the internet and see the news. I was moved to tears. How could I be so affected by this guy I never knew? I felt like I lost a friend. He just seemed like such a nice guy both in his films and out. I have heard that Paul's family wanted them to finish the film he had started and they did a pretty darn good job. The ending is appropriate and poignant. When you see it, you realize it doesn't make sense as the ending of this film per se, it's really the cast and producers saying goodbye to Paul. The image of Walker in that final scene is a much earlier one or an amalgam of his various faces through the years. It really is a goodbye between him and ""Dom"" and it's beautifully done. He will be missed."
7,"Of course you don't expect much from the story of a film like this, so I will tell you about everything else: cars, planes, cars, tall buildings, cars, attack helicopters, cars, drones, cars, demolishing buildings... did I mention cars?In truth, the cars scenes were not so relevant. It all felt like they struggled to find reasons to use cars in an otherwise completely unrelated scenario. Jason Statham comes off as a real badass, The Rock is as usually huge and intimidating, but in this film Vin Diesel just outmanned everybody. He is a beast!So if you want spectacular scenes that have no regard to logic, this is the film for you. Unfortunately, I would have preferred the last film in the series to have been more meaningful. Instead they just babbled on about family and destroyed cars. The property damage inflicted to kill two assassins and save a hacker was probably in the tens of millions, if not more."
7,"Furious 7 rides into theaters, yet again. Taking place, after the events of 2003's Fast & Furious Tokyo Drift & 2013's Fast & Furious 6. The story brings all the characters from the previous films, back together for one more adventure. In this movie, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew, are faced with a sinister foe, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), whom seeks revenge for his comatose brother. Directed by James Wan, the movie combine, most of the plot threads of the previous films into one. It moves as if it's recapping the previous films. The plot get more and more out there. With each passing film you can see it becoming more and more far- fetched. The movie starts out, with car racing like the first movie, 2001's Fast & Furious. It then goes into a heist sub-plot like 2011's Fast Five, and then the movie go into the spy genre, like Fast & Furious 6. In many ways, it's nearly a complete movie. Once again, the movie brings over the top action. Without spoiling too much, I found a few things about the film action, a bit jarring. I really didn't buy into most of the actions scene, because how unrealistic, it was. There were a lot of BS scenes where the hero walk away, nearly unscratched, when they should be, dead or in serious condition. If you're a fan of more realistic action, this movie might not be for you. If you like over the top. It's full of it. I think the highlight of the film, has to be the Abu Dhabi heist sequences. It was so testosterone full! I love the fight scenes between Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) & Deckard Shaw. Jason Statham makes a great villain. It's too bad, that the movie didn't focus on him, as much, as it should had. I really thought, the movie would had work better, if he was the main villain, rather than the large number of sub-villains, they had for the crew, to fight against. Who knew, that Djimon Hounsou's character, Jakande, would be just as huge as a threat as Deckard Shaw? I didn't see, that coming from the trailers. I really didn't see Kara (Ronda Rousey) being a minor character. I thought, she was working for Shaw. Instead, she was working for some prince. Still, the fight between Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) & Kara (Ronda Rousey) was pretty awesome. Like, I said before, honestly, how many movies are they going to make out of these characters? I know, most of the actors can't find work outside from the popular Fast and Furious film series, but seriously, it's the 7th movie in film series. It's clear, that these actors only got this franchise to keep their careers, going. The actors are indeed, 'One trick Ponies'. Don't get me wrong, they're alright in the film, but I'm really getting annoyed by the lead actor, Vin Diesel's mumbling and lazy not buff, look. Unfortunately, one of the better actors, Paul Walker, was killed in a car accident, during filming, which lead to Vin Diesel having a bigger role in the film. Director James Wan did the best, he can, to replace Paul Walker, by giving Walker's dialogue to other characters, or having Paul Walker's brothers as stand ins. For the most part, it kinda works, but there were a few shadowy back-head or far away shots that clearly made, because Paul Walker wasn't there, anymore. Once again, actors Tyrese Gibson & Ludicrous are the comic reliefs. Tyrese Gibson's Roman still gives, some good one-liners and zingers, but he's a little more annoying now, since the movie made him, look more like a coward. Ludicrous's Tej is a little more unbelievable. It's weird that he's the tech guy, now. It's also strange, that he knows karate, now too. The cameos in the film was alright for the most part. I wish, Lucas Black's Sean Boswell, had a bigger part. I wouldn't call this movie, a stand-alone film. There is a lot of things you wouldn't get if you didn't watch the previous films. The movie is a bit long. They added a lot of tiresome long scenes, like skydiving in cars to rescue an important kidnapped hacker, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) for a mysterious secret agent (Kurt Russell). The whole God's eye subplot wasn't really needed. I know, it is paper thin, but they would had stretch out the revenge plot. I came to see this movie just for that. Due to that add, this film became the longest movie in the series so far. Another fault of the film, is how they treat women. They parade them as sex objects. Michelle Rodriguez and Nathalie Emmanuel are strong, smart female role models, even though the movie does objectify them physically. There are tons of bikini shots and car porn that can make any young man, horny as hell. Overall: I really don't understand why films like this, get a higher score, than Michael Bay films. It's nearly has the same stupid problems. Too many explosion, clumsy writing and degrading stereotypes and women. I guess, Fast & Furious just have more loyal fans. Still, the best thing about this film, is how they handled the tragic death of lead Paul Walker with admirable grace, ultimately creating an emotionally impactful farewell. Despite, the natured absurdity of this world, it still worth seeing, only for that, alone."
7,"i went to cinema for i-max 3d, i'll not recommend for i-max 3d, the cut is very fast, my friend sit next to me feel fuzzy after watched, director James who really like a lot of fast cut, jump cut for some point, camera rotate style in action.... This is a fantastic conclusion to honor Paul Walker's death. The cast are same, as usual funny Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous, there is another cast like Jason who quite the same Jason, Tony who also same as usual good perform of action martial art, very entertaining, but i personally still feel that FF6 is better than 7. i am appreciated to all the crew to bring me exciting, fun, cool action. Director James Wan is better direct the horror film than direct an action. I'm not saying James is worse, i can see he put an effort but his style is not suitable for this"
7,"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.
Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.
In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer."
7,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point."
7,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing"
7,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope."
7,"The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, technically, it is extremely well done and Phoenix's performance is really quite extraordinary (he is definitely looking at an Oscar nomination), but despite excellent writing, acting and direction........the film is kinda boring.It had its moments, and, sure, it has some very disturbing elements but....If I had a watch, I would have looked at it many times as what this film lacks is...excitement.The final act is most excellent, but it felt like it took forever to get to it."
7,"While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance."
7,"A confused representation of insanity from a perspective of a sane person, a celebration of madness and chaos.
At last, I have watched one of the most anticipated movies of this year.
I experienced sadness, creepiness, joy, rage, confusion altogether, and it felt good.
The story was above average, sometimes the director seemed confused about what he's trying to say.
There were so many beautiful distinct pieces scattered throughout the film that gives you chills but ultimately they failed to form a complete landscape, eventually it became a gorgeously crafted baroque film with a sheer hollow inside.
It criticizes our self-centered, pretentious, empathy less society but ironically the movie itself falls under its own sword.Welcome, Tod Phillips to the big boy's club! His direction was crafty and pretty awesome though lack a little bit of originality. His trick with Arthur's illusion seemed a bit risky given its context. We will never know for sure if Arthur did go Murray's show or not!The cinematography was superb, there were plenty of scenes that'll enter your mind and stay there for a while.Joaquin Phoenix did his best, tried hard to embody the magnanimous character of Joker, he did pretty well, but sometimes it felt he was just trying too hard. Despite it's unfair to compare him with great heath ledger I must say he was able to pull it off impressively and takes this Joker to a distinct level. It was a one-man show and he's gonna get nominated for the academy award for sure.One of the most entertaining and satisfying aspects of this film is its music composition, damn! It was too good, and you'll get to see some insane dance move as a bonus.
The main problem with this film is the lack of originality and a precise plot, sometimes it felt like the movie itself was confused and wandering aimlessly! That's why it failed to become a complete cinematic art rather than a montage of eye pleasing scenes, and nothing more.Overall, despite its shortcomings, this movie is definitely one of the most exciting movie of this year.My Rating:7.5/10"
7,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is excellent, but the film is flawed, the main offenders being a second act twist that's visible a mile away and a small scene during the ending that feels tacked on.However, you should see this film at least once."
7,"How is this Joker suppost to stand a chance against Batman? I thought what made joker such a great villain was his intelligence, his manipulative ability and his ability to see the inner fears of his rivals. How far will he get by only being crazy and unpredictable? Juaquin could problably get pretty far (all the way to the Oscars stage), while Joker can't even enter through a door."
7,"But the 10 star reviews that came flooding in were too much for me to take seriously, and I was right.By all means, go see Joker - it's a standalone origin story that needs no knowledge of the Batman series, but it also rewards fans of that series with some very convincing details and very believable storytelling.I won't get into the plot, but there are some twists. Very well done, in fact, even though they are both reminiscent of certain M. Knight Shymalan films. Very tastefully done and expertly integrated into the storyline without overindulgence and quite important for the story and character arcs at play. Bravo in that respect.Also, applause for the cinematography, the style, the homages to previous classics and just the wonderfully realistic atmosphere that the director and his crew were able to bring to life here. Positively the most believable and realistic Gotham ever. Some might find that to be a veiled critique, but it makes this film watchable and enjoyable by those who have no knowledge of the Batman franchise(s).Just altogether airtight production and direction. Hands down.The only gripe I have is with the score - not the songs, necessarily, but the use of over-dramatic violin/cello passages and too-loud unnecessary (and very dark) orchestral pieces that almost take the audience out of the experience. Those who have seen it may know what I am talking about, but no spoilers.All in all, this is very much worth watching even if I feel as though it may spawn some copycats in real life - sure to have a long ""cult film"" life after it fades from the cinemas.7.5/10 with no caveats."
7,"In Gotham City, the clown and aspirant comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is an outcast mentally disturbed man that lives with his deranged mother Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy). When the social service office that attends him is shutdown, Arthur stops his medication and the abusive society drives him crazier to a criminal life.""Joker"" is a dark and depressive film that discloses a dramatic version of the Joker´s origin. Joaquin Phoenix has a top-notch performance in the role of a mentally disturbed man disregarded by the society with a nervous twitch. His acting makes the viewer recalls and compares with Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"", the best so far. The dark and gruesome cinematography shows a dirty Gotham City with the garbage collector strike. The music score is also spectacular with hits from the 70´s and 80´s. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Coringa"" (""Joker"")"
7,"Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
Arthur FleckThat definitely feels true. Joker is set in the early 80s and is loosely based on the origin of the Joker (DC Comic character and arch rival of Batman). This version is written and directed by Todd Phillips (the director of The Hangover films...yep) and stars Joaquin Phoenix in the title role.Almost everyone has their opinion of the film and how they feel about it, so take what you can from them, but, this is what I thought of it.The Joker is a gritty hard hitting study of a man's decline into madness. Arthur Fleck is a lonely troubled man, who between caring for his ill mother and performing for kids as a clown, dreams of being a stand up comedian - his only problem, he isn't very funny.This sounds familiar and fans of Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese will recall King of Comedy (1982) and the painful Rupert Pupkin having the same dilemma (incidentally De Niro plays the chat show host Murray Franklin whom Arthur adores). Unfortunately Arthur or 'happy' as his mother calls him is living in a world that just doesn't understand him, again sound familiar? Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver (1976). Clearly these two films have influenced Phillips and he borrows seamlessly from them, but this is not in the same calibre as these, it stands alone.The central performance from Joaquin Phoenix delivers the punchlines (sorry). His lean skeleton holds the meat of the film (sorry again). He is mesmerising, he portrays sadness, depression, anger, loneliness and happiness brilliantly. It's a masterclass on acting, he lives and breathes the character.The supporting cast is good, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy to name, watch out for Glenn Fleshler (Remus from Boardwalk Empire) and Brian Tyree Henry (Paper Boi from Atlanta).The music is standout, Icelandic Hildur Gudnadottir sets the right tone and style to the film (to be noted she did the music for this and Chernobyl at around the same time). There has been some subject of debate for one music choice and I don't why that particular piece of music was used when others could have been selected, perhaps Phillips was wanting the reaction? (jerk). The cinematography is good and adds grittiness to the screen, the makeup is good too, I like how Phoenix has adopted a different clown paint - slightly reminiscent of Doink the Clown from WWE though).The film is rated R so be prepared to see violence, however there are probably less deaths in here than in most of the Marvel films, yep, and when it happens you can feel the magnitude of it.I would still recommend seeing this (unless you have coulrophobia) and making your own mind up on how you feel about it, one thing is for certain you will be talking about it for some time, which is what Phillips probably wanted - 'send in the clowns...they are already here'."
7,"J. Phoenix must have lost a lot of weight for this role, which I guess was one of the biggest reasons he won all the awards. Yes, he was awesome, but the movie wasn't. It needed more action. The film is about the descent of a mentally ill man, failed by society, as he becomes more unstable and eventually leads to murder. He learns his mother has been lying to him and becomes unglued around her. The only thing I didn't get was this supposed to be the same Joker whom squares off with Batman. Because Bruce Wayne is just a kid and Arthur already looks to be 40 something. so how is that. And at the end he is in a facility, well how does he do the things the Joker did. Are we to assume he escaped or the Joker in Batman was a copy cat.FINAL VERDICT: Good film, but overrated. Worth checking out."
7,"Joaquin Phoenix was SUPERB as a mentally disturbed person that had been emotionally and physically abused as a child. After having grown into an adult, the mental illness increased and deepened. Joaquin deserved to win BEST actor in the Academy Awards. With that being said, this movie was one of the most disturbing and twisted movies I've seen. The script must have been written by someone who was deeply full of despondency, sadness and despair. Disturbing movie. Excellent acting."
7,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you againThis was a journey into the land of insanity
I really enjoyed Joker's stroll into the realm of psychosis.Sanity is such a delicate, tentative, state of being, the Joker would know.
The problem with insanity is how incredibly sane it feels."
7,The acting was phenomenal but the movie was bad. I'd give it 5/5 acting and 2/5 storyline. Joaquin Phoenix deserved his Oscar.
7,"Certainly it's difficult to disagree that Joaquin Phoenix gave an excellent performance of a seemingly real person suffering from real issues, but the story was slow-paced and entirely depressing."
7,"""Every story needs its hero. And its villain. And its monster.""
The Caped Crusader of Gotham City was never complete without his villain, the Joker. What made The Dark Knight (2008) a phenomenal success at the box office and as an all time cult classic was the characterization of the agent of chaos and seamless delivery of witful dialogues and challenges. It wasn't a surprise that the people loved the Joker more than the Batman himself in the film, for he, the Joker, didn't have any rules to play by. It was unfortunate that Heath Ledger had to leave this world, and thus creating a permanent vacuum in the Gotham City. There had been attempts by Jared Leto to fulfill the gap, but it is no match.DC had to come up with a solo Joker movie that was due for long. Joaquin Phoenix had been creating the buzz ever since the first look poster arrived and looks-wise he was almost..almost matching the legend of Heath Ledger. With much expectations, the Joker is finally here.Set in 1981, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a disregarded personality who works as a clown at places wherever needed and lives with his mom Penny. With a rare neurological condition, he suffers from frequent and inopportune laughter which irks people around him. The city as such is infested with crime and unemployment all over, hence there is no question of sympathy or concern for special characters such as him. Struggling to make a mark as a stand up comedian, Arthur also suffers from delusions where he is unable to distinguish reality from dreams. Things go topsy-turvy when one of his colleagues hands him over a gun to take care of miscreants who harm him. Arthur uses it against 3 rogue employees of Wayne Enterprises. While the cops are in search for Arthur, he also is in constant battle to come up as a comedian, pursue his neighborhood crush, find out the true identity of his father and take care of his mom. When he finds an answer to most of these, how he handles them and emerges as the Gotham City rebellion is the plot.The movie has its high moments in the seamless change of expressions and body language of Joaquin. The audience will be in for a shock to see his shirtless episodes where he reminds one of Christian Bale from The Machinist (2004 The background score in most places takes the cue from The Dark Knight and builds over it to make us feel the connect. Also there are too many frames that resemble the ones of Heath Ledger, which possibly could be a deliberate attempt. ). For those expecting a Batman cameo in this movie - the answer is both YES and NO.While this movie could easily be a grandeur in performances, one cannot get the rush that was given by the one played by Heath Ledger. Surely, there cannot be a comparison to the 2008 Joker version, for that set its standards too high that any more attempts can only keep trying to scale up half way. We can only hope the sequel to this one has much more interesting elements, for the movie ends with enough scope for that hope!"
7,"From the director of ""The Hangover"" trilogy comes a dark and gritty version of Joker's origin story. His version of the Joker seems to be heavily inspired by Martin Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy"" with a touch of ""Taxi Driver"". On top of that, there are some attempts of commentary about society and how crooked it is. When you mix all those things up, you get a film that's going to divide everyone's opinions.Let's begin with the good stuff first. Easily, the best part of the film was a performance by Joaquin Phoenix. He carried this film completely and he gave one of the better performances of his career (nothing is going to beat his performance in ""The Master""). He proved once again why he's one of the best actors working today. If someone else was in his place, there's no way this film would've worked. His mannerisms, facial expressions (especially how he showed so many different emotions through laughs and eye expressions at the same time), his physicality and his vulnerability were incredible. If this film received a bit better reviews he would definitely be the main contender for that Oscar. Furthermore, the next aspect with which I was blown away was the score. I would even say that the score was a more effective way of showing emotions than the script. Because of the score at every moment, you knew how you were supposed to feel regarding what's happening on the screen, and that was achieved in a way that wasn't forceful. If you listen carefully to the score, you can even distinguish what scenes happened in reality and which were just in his imagination. Those two aspects of the film were outstanding and they carried the film noticeably. The color palette really nicely supported the script. Through the colors in the film, you could've seen in what mood the main character was and how he felt about what was happening around him. Colors helped to immerse the audience into that time period (I would say the film happened in 1981 because the movie theatre was showing the film ""Blow Out"" which came out in that year), but that wouldn't work without production design which was on the point.
The cinematography was decent. Although the director's vision wasn't groundbreaking I generally enjoyed most of the camera choices.Let's get into some aspects that weren't so good. The script. It's one of the weakest parts of the film. You get a feeling the film wanted to say a lot, but unfortunately, it ended up saying almost nothing. There were a lot of attempts to give some social commentary, but for me personally, that fell flat because there wasn't any explanation of why is everything how it is. Joker as a character for the huge part of the film was complaining about how society is bad and how everyone is mean, but there wasn't any reason given why is the world like that, beyond poverty and poor people suck and rich people are corrupted and evil. Regarding that specific aspect, I felt like the director wanted to say a lot, but it just ended up being shallow and on the nose. The film was beating you over the head of how everything is bad. I would've appreciated concluding by myself that the world is crooked, but instead, I was just told what the situation was, without any room for my own interpretations. And that explained situation wasn't backed up with any other pieces of information. This time, tell don't show approach didn't work out. Furthermore, speaking of the script, all characters except Joker were unbelievable and underwritten. Zazie Beetz was completely unutilized and the relationship between her character and the Joker was underdeveloped. The film was supposed to make you believe in their relationship, but it didn't and because of it the film suffered at the later stages of its runtime. I understood what did film tried to achieve with their relationship, but that wasn't realized very well. That sentence could've been used for many aspects of this film. Robert De Niro as an older version of Rupert Pupkin had a ton of fun in this film, one of the better De Niro's performances since ""Casino"". They could've done more with his character, but at least it seemed like he had fun with this project. So, Joker is basically the only character that was decently written, but the thing is, the director didn't make a clear choice if we were supposed to feel for him or we were supposed to hate him because of his actions. Don't get me wrong, he isn't a good person, but the film way too many times tried to make the audience sympathize with him. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but at the times it felt way too forceful.In the end, looking at the whole picture, this is a good film but isn't anything spectacular. At the same time, I would say the film was overblown with praises of how good it was, and yet at the same time, it was unfairly criticized because of some aspects in the film (e.g. the usage of violence)."
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as ""The Hangover"" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, ""I have nothing but bad thoughts"", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any ""real"" Batman references.Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for ""Chernobyl"") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", Jimmy Durante singing ""Smile"", Cream's ""White Room"", ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar ""Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2"". The ""Smile"" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind."
7,Other than that. This is a well directed movie with great performances.
7,"Like this movie or not, you have to agree its at least a breath of fresh air. Phoenix does a great job at channeling just the right amount of psycho to portray the Joker.The cinematography and lighting is very well done and really sets the atmosphere. While I agree with some that the morales of the movie can be misconstrued, it seems to be about coming out of your shell to be your true self and not caring what others think.I did feel at times the movie was a bit preachy though. The whole ""we live in a society..."" comes off rather strong towards the end. Society and rich people = bad!! That was a bit too on the nose.I also never really got the notion that this Joker was clever or intelligent in this movie. He just seemed psychotic. Which is really only a small part of what makes the character scary.Now, I get that its from the Jokers point of view, but the Waynes and almost ALL other characters are just shown to be total one dimensional a-holes that we dont really have sympathy for. This could have been handled better I believe.BUT, what makes these bad things listed above so interesting, is the very real possibility that the events in the film were actually all in the Jokers mind. Its established early on that he has delusions often, so the entire revolution and his rise to hero status could have very well been all imagined, which makes a lot of sense.In conclusion though, I appreciated the risks the movie took and performance given by Phoenix. It was a fresh take on an already well established character, which can be difficult to do. And considering all of the god awful movies released now a days, I cant blame people who praise it as a perfect 10. Its deff worth it to give it a watch for yourself."
7,"Regardless of whether you like it or hate it, I think the film explores how the Joker is the way he is because he can't be otherwise, literally. One of the greatest dangers to America itself is American culture. It's not terrorism that will destroy America; it's American culture that will ultimately be the undoing of America. The film looks to examine our distorted points of view or detachments from reality and show us that WE, as a society, have the same characteristics of the Joker. The Joker is a product of this materialistic culture we live under. Epistemically western culture is motivated by striving for money, status and recognition, which is focused on results and efficiency but that can have severe consequences because you're always judging yourself with the person next to you.The movie Joker is what you get when you take American culture, and you take it to its pinnacle. When you exaggerate it to the extreme, you get someone like the Joker. But the critical hidden message is that we need to become more aware of our OWN double standards within ourselves. We need to start to empathize that we have the same mechanisms as the Joker has. So, on the one hand, I can criticize the Joker, but on the other side, I can also see why he acts the way he does, but more importantly see it collectively. Notice that trying to rid the world of evil only creates more evil. Everything you might criticize; corporate greed, different beliefs, religion, people you dislike, violence, war, mass shootings, even just hating this movie - We like to criticize things, but while we're criticizing, we're NOT really thinking about how we ourselves are part of the very same problem that is contributing to the cycle."
7,"Im not sure whether I enjoyed the movie, but it left me with themes to think. Whether everything happened as a delusion or in reality,is a question. The actor's talent is best reflected through character. But its hard to justify giving death as punishment. Still a lot more to think about even after finishing watching movie."
7,"Overall, the acting is the best part of the movie. Most of all Joaquin, but also Di Niro and the wonderful Frances Conroy (big fan).
However, several skills of the Joker were left out, f. e. top strategist or excellent chemist. What was left is a so-and-so comedian bordering on looser turning into a psychopath. And please, the cliche of bad childhood and the mother did him wrong, etc.... Worth a big Joker laugh.
I also missed the grand finale, maybe Arthur is using the raids to increase them, creating chaos, etc.
In the end it is a good movie about the Character development from looser to psycho. Not new, but well done and acted. For me it is just not the title character.I will be happy if Joaquin might get an Oscar or Frances as supporting actress, but can't see the movie deserving more awards.About the often in the media mentioned brutality... Well brutal behavior in a movie about a psychopath.... Wow... I am shocked... Who would have thought... *end sarcasm* 😂"
7,"This movie has as much traction and grip, as the car that won Le Mans 66!Another stunning performance by Christian Bale (without any body transformation this time!) and the same goes for Jon Bernthal! Yes, this movie might be 20mins to long, but it takes you on a long and exciting ride with an end you won't see coming, unless you spoil yourself with how the race in '66 ended - my advice: DON'T! it will pay off.I'm a Formula 1 enthusiast and occasionally watch the Le Mans races as well, so I wasn't aware how the race in '66 ended. I wasn't even aware of the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then, but this movie won't bore you with the details to much. It gives the necessary overview of the needed context, so that every viewer understands what's on the line here.I'd recommend a viewing in an IMAX for sure, to feel the sound and experience the race for yourself. Much like Rush, this movie manages to get the excitement of racing transformed to the audience, without focussing on any crashes or the (back then) still live threatening motorsport."
7,"""Ford v Ferrari"" isn't as much about the battle between the two mega-corporations in the title as much as it is about the fight between bureaucracy and action, calculations and instinct or faith and palpability. It involves internal struggles as much as external ones and carried superbly by its two leads, Matt Damon and Christian Bale--whose performance is Oscar-worthy--is one of the most likable, satisfying and entertaining movies of the year.The plot heads towards an epic culmination at the 1966 24-hour Le Mans race in France and it involves the years in which Ford created the now legendary GT40 to finally beat Ferrari who has been dominating the racing realm of motoring for years. It follows car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they deal with the technical ins and outs, corporate interference and media standards navigating their vagaries to get to success. The movie is as old-school macho as its central characters. Shelby was an American maverick, always dressing like the boss he is, always determined to get the job done, but he was understanding of the business side. Miles, on the other hand, is as complicated as he is a brilliant driver. His approach to the world is stripped of formality, his driving is his religion and people should be as real as he is otherwise they become fodder for his unfiltered words.James Mangold knew he was entering a world with high potential in entertainment when he approached this story. Whenever attempting to encompass American history, one tends to sensationalize through patriotism and venerate the people it contains. And indeed they are worthy of veneration. This plays out like standard Hollywood fare, the dream factory working its magic perfectly. But it's also very male-centric. Not only its characters look like they were made in a car factory, the women are also hysterical. A particular scene in which Ken's wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) has a nervous breakdown during an argument with Ken about him hiding his plan to work on the new GT40 is a bit exaggerated. As they are in their family car, she starts driving erratically and dangerously, the scene playing like an interrogation scene. ""I thought we loved this stuff!""--she yells until Ken spits everything out. Yet in the end, she is fine with it, she just wished he hadn't lied. Her worries are understandable and called for, but her over-the-top reaction Mangold decided upon is obsolete as representation for women--even if this was the 1960s.In the end, though, ""Ford v Ferrari"" finishes with just the right amount of satisfaction. While both characters are likable and Bale's performance rules, Matt Damon's portrayal of Carroll Shelby is what really made me up this movie's grade. He is perfect as men who try to get the job done but also not upset anyone too much. His approach to Ford's CEO, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) on why he should get a second chance after losing in 1965's Le Mans is as elegant as it is harsh and true. Even if ""Ford v Ferrari"" seems a bit outdated it is nonetheless a movie which really wants to be liked--not only by car people, but by everyone. Well, it succeeded."
7,"Going in, I knew this film had no shot of being a 10/10 for me. I am about as far from a gearhead or racing fan as one can be. With that being said, I was still intrigued throughout the entire 2.5 hour run time. Christian Bale dominated the screen with his performance. I expect great things from him, but he really did outdo himself by portraying the oddities and ego of his character. If you are a fan of cars or racing, I imagine you will love Ford v Ferrari."
7,"The (mostly) true story of two passionate gear-heads and their tireless quest to unseat mighty Team Ferrari at the grueling 24-hour Le Mans endurance race. Armed, that is, with the financial backing (and all-too frequent corporate meddling) of Ford Motor Company. In that sense, it's a war on two fronts: they're playing catch-up against a more advanced opponent while also fending off the various obstacles and bad ideas tossed down from their own corporate brass.Christian Bale and Matt Damon, somehow sharing the screen for the first time, provide all the personality this flick needs to maintain momentum, while the hair-raising cockpit scenes nail the hairpin turns. Bale plays the more fiery of the pair; a sparky, cocksure driver who comes out of near-retirement for this chance at immortality. Damon's man is full of piss and vinegar, too, but more amicable to the kind of machinations necessary for navigating a corporate American boardroom. From the first word, they're great together. It's not an easy relationship to define - blows are exchanged, often comically, more than once - but there's no arguing their kinship, even if both might brush it off as a mere working association. They both know the fine points of their job, and the slight quirks and deviations that make them essential to one another.Several of the film's plot twists are telegraphed, even for those (like I) who didn't know the full story coming in, and it's guilty of occasionally dipping into the well of over-worn sports movie tropes, but otherwise it's an effective pulse-pounder."
7,A pretty good movie really. Tells a good yarn. Nicely made. Good cinematography. Good acting and good character chemistry. Lots of cgi but merges in quite well. Generally historically accurate. Nice plot in that it creates two anti-heroes battling against being the underdogs and battling against the ruthless ambitions of their own sponsors. Pretty standard stuff really. Bale's UK Midlands accent is pretty poor but just about better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney chimney sweep! Given that he is English it should be better - but he nevertheless presents a likeable character. Damon presents no surprises as the ultimate straight man - but he always does this well. It could have finished nicely without showing Miles' demise - a footnote would have respectfully sufficed. But other than this I'm struggling to really fault the film. Naturally it does gloss over certain aspects of the real story and outside of the USA no one refers to the race as the 24 hours 'OF' Le Mans - but does it really matter and does it detract from the overall story? No of course not. This is exactly what it says on the tin. No more and no less. I refer to my title.😀
7,It's an interesting story worth watching even if you're not into racing or cars. It's a marketing lesson.
7,"I didn't know anything about Ford's history with 24 Hours of Le Man, really, but Ford v Ferrari does a good job of conveying of how important it was to those involved. Christian Bale's portrayal of Ken Miles is particularly impressive, making him both aggravating and sympathetic at the same time. This film is educational, engaging and it gives us the epic Batman vs. Jason Bourne fight scene we've all been waiting for."
7,"People who love cars must watch this movie. Those who are not interested in cars must watch. :) The acting is great, the script is great."
7,This movie is fun to watch. Only I wouldn't watch it again. It is better than the average movies though it is not the greatest.
7,"Fantastic interpretation from Christian Bale. One of his bests.
Nice balance of comedy and drama. I don't fully understand the character development of some of the protagonists. The side cast (wife, petty vice president) feels kinda cliché; I like the interaction, even though they don't provide enough conflict. The main antagonist, Ferrari, has some nice shots but they're not a real threat because we're too immersed into the main character's personal struggle for perfection.
That finale, that missing victory, gives a lot of weight to the whole final act and to the good relationships between Miles and Shelby. But if we look at being and end point, it really says much. I'm a bit disappointed yet happy about the overall movie."
7,My family members keep wanting to go back. I've enjoyed it all three times. Christian Bale became a different person in the show. I forgot it was him and was totally into the character. Matt Damon's portrayal of Shelby also was excellent.
7,"Let's get the negatives quickly out of the way. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies in this one and some play major parts in the story. But it is quite impossible to cram 5 or more years of reality, into 150 minutes of film. So, it is a pass for me.What i really didn't like though, was the racing/action scenes. There wasn't any sense of speed in them. Instead there was a lot of camera trembling, sped-up shots and cgi. That was a real let down in a film that has a car as one of the main protagonists.On the other hand the actors were all brilliant. From the main man (Damon), to the bad guy (Lucas), to the daredevil (Bale) everyone added significant parts to plot and character development.The plot was going to be good because the real story had all the ingredients for a Hollywood movie. Danger, emotion and underdog status, along with the sad story of a man capable of greatness, but always on the out of the corporate new world.And last but not least, the cars were simply fantastic. The Cobras, Mustangs and GT40s from Ford, alongside the main opposition in the Ferrari 330 P3. Majestic!
Even if you know the story or don't, petrolhead or not, it is a very well made film that you have to see."
7,"As a huge fan of Christian Bale, and an even bigger fan of Enzo Ferrari and the journey behind the Ferrari perfection, it was a story which grabbed me from the first frame and held me captivated to the last frame. The element of Ford becoming not only a contender but a winner of the Le Mans, not really a spoiler it's already down in the books, does very little in itself, however the journey and the eccentricness of the man behind the wheel who helped make it possible was the films shinning beacon. Also appreciated the short inserts of Lee Iacocca and his contribution to the Ford racing program. Ford v Ferrari puts a fresh perspective on a moment in history which most would most likely care less about, but it does it in a way which could be entertaining for a whole family. It's the classic underdog story, which that character arc which you would expect, but with an altruistic defiance to confirm and follow rules which add an almost James Dean rebel without a cause type flare to this film. All in all fun film and entertaining."
7,"I'm not much of a car fanatic let alone racing fanatic but the story had me intrigued enough to go see it and I was not disappointed!Ford v Ferrari tells the story of how Ford made it's first racing car with an aim to win the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans in France over Ferrari who had won the last four years. At its core however it is the story American car designer Carroll Shelby and British driver Ken Miles who made it happen and their relationship.Let's start first at where credit is due - with Christian Bale. Another terrific performance and he pretty much steals the show in his portrayal of Ken Miles. Tough to do staring alongside Matt Damon who also delivers a fantastic performance. Yet each role he takes on, Bale seems to be able to do no wrong.I also really enjoyed the scenes in the car during races and practice runs. The shots included during the 24 Hours of Le Mans race of the track seen both within the car and also of the race, were really impressive. It gave a real authenticity to what it must feel like being in one of those races, similar to how Ride Like a Girl did the same for horse racing.The film isn't a 100% reflection on actual events, as there is more to this story which I have since been learning about. DO NOT let you stop you from seeing this film! I guarantee you'll get something out of it. It might even peak your curiosity as it did mine."
7,"Matt Damon and Christian Bale star in this 2019 drama based on true events. This takes place in the 1960's and Damon (The Martian) plays racecar driver turned designer, Carroll Shelby who works for the Ford Motor company. He tries to save the business from taking a nosedive from competing company, Ferrari by designing a new, faster Ford model with help from his mechanic friend, Ken Miles (Bale) who not only agrees, but wants to drive it as well. When the corporate execs disapprove of Miles, Shelby puts his job on the line to help his friend be the first to drive the car and win the La Mans race. This is a good bio drama with humorous, dramatic and thrilling moments, Damon & Bale are great in it and together. I recommend this."
7,"When you accept that this is a mainstream movie you enjoy the (real) story and racing scenes. We can complain about how we get to see main character's life so little even his devastation at some point. However, they did really great job on racing scenes. Only thing that i can complain about is that the ending could be more painful to win(maybe some suspense). It was kinda all about victories throughout the whole movie and nothing really bad happened. But yea anyway it was fun to see."
7,"This long movie is quite involving and the races are exciting. The in the driver's seat point of view makes the races exciting and the David v Goliath thing always gets you rooting for the underdog. Enjoyable even for non race car enthusiasts. The actors are good from main to supporting. Bale is convincing as the driver. Damon looks suitably tired and puffy as the ex driver turned designer.Some faults - Some scenes could have been cut. The wife's hissy fit could have been cut. Josh Lucas' mini nasty character was over done for the sake of having a villain, Jez Butterworth the screen writer wrote plays that have made it to Broadway and are excruciatingly and unnecessarily long. Don't understand some of the strong accents of Christian Bale and his wife. The movie should have ended right after Le Mans. Less of a downer if they had."
7,"Let me preface this by saying that I am quite a car guy. Not the type whose entire life revolves around cars, but I own a sports car and enjoy the odd track day. This means suspending my disbelief in a car movie is always a hard thing...... but this movie certainly doesn't make it easy! For a car-movie aimed at car people, it was strange to find it packed with inaccuracies and car cliches. The idea that a car explodes whenever it rolls or makes contact with a hard object had finally died in most of Hollywood's mainstream products. Why bring it back in a car-movie?Here are a few others:
-Ken's car seems to be so fast that he can catch up from with everybody whenever he decides to. Why isn't he winning in the first place?
-There's this cliche that racers can overtake each other in a straight line by deciding to press the throttle harder. Again, why aren't they already doing that?
-Brake fade and braking points obviously don't happen that way, and swapping out a knuckle assembly to cool the brakes is like buying a new phone because the home button is dead (oh wait...). Ford did come up with a quick brake-change solution (which almost every new car uses), but it looked nothing like this.
-the 7000rpm ramble present from the opening lines of the movie (and the movie's overall interpretation of RPM) is rather detached from reality. Different engine architectures behave differently at different RPMs, trying to pin that on a single value is strange and unneeded
-Sorry but car guys would never use ""her"" to refer to their automobile! It's not a ship!With that out of the way, on to the movie stuff:
-the writing team tries very hard to make the story overly dramatic, by utilizing lazy writing tricks (the Daytona bet, for example), which really shouldn't be necessary considering how fascinating the base story already is
-Christian Bale is a very good actor, but he really overdoes the Ken Miles character. There is close to no footage of the actual guy, so he had the opportunity to build whatever character and mimics he felt like. Why he chose to go so incredibly over the top (both in accentuation and behavior) is beyond me
-There's a lot of CG going on during the races. Quite a lot. It is not badly executed, but was it really necessary? There are historic races at Le Mans they could have taken footage from rather than leave us in the uncanny valleyIt's not all bad though. The story's a highly interesting one, and Matt Damon's performance is very good. His relationship with Ken Miles is touching, and having them compete against their own headquarters makes for a great double-sided challenge. And while the production's runtime is on the longer side of things, it never feels so.To sum things up, it is a more than decent movie (hence the 7/10 rating), and probably does a great job at translating what car racing feels like to people who aren't into it or know little about it (my wife had a really good time and enjoyed the movie's constant suspense, as well as its visuals and performances, so it's got to be doing something right!). However, it's neither Oscar-Winning, nor even remotely accurate when it comes to car stuff."
7,"""Ford v Ferrari"" juggles enough fast cars, heart and fine performances to entertain you all the way through.
.
In this sports drama based on a true story, a team of determined engineers make it a mission to build a Ford vehicle fast enough to beat Ferrari in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
.
Running a little over two and a half hours, ""Ford v Ferrari"" can be tighter, but the film overall is a fun ride and a solid underdog story. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a dynamic duo and offer viewers two whole-hearted and grand performances. Director James Mangold (""Walk The Line"") makes you feel like you're on that race track and also makes you want to stand up and cheer. An entertaining piece of automotive history that not many people know about and well worth the watch."
7,"Decent movie. But i don't understand what's missing. May be the casting. In this movie, I just watched Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Not the actual characters. Cinematography not so powerful. Sound editing really well -At the end you are watching a race car based movie. Sound must be well- I cannot praise character build up as well. Some of them are just there like John Bernthal. Anyway, it's a nice movie to spend couple of hours for fun. If you have a nice sound system just wait for BR."
7,"""Ford v Ferrari"" (2019 release; 152 min.) brings the true story of the showdown at the 24 hrs of LeMans in 1966. As the movie opens, we see Carroll Shelby in a flashback win the 1959 LeMans. We then go forward a few years when Henry Ford II address the Ford factory floor asking for some good new ideas. Up-and-coming executive Lee Iacocca suggests buying the struggling Ferrari car manufacturer but the deal fails. In a parallel story, we get to know rebel driver Ken Miles.... At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from director James Mansfield (The Wolverine; Logan). Here he brings to the screen the heated rivalry between two very different giants in the car industry: Ford and Ferrari. The movie starts promisingly, but pretty soon we are bogged down in all kinds of corporate background and infighting that play out for way too long. Honestly, the movie could've been trimmed by 20 to 25 minutes in the movie's first half, and would not have lost any of the movie's essence. Matt Damon en Christian Bale are terrific in the lead roles of Shelby and Miles. The actual racing sequences are entertaining and loud, very loud.The movie opened wide the previous weekend, too great acclaim and box office success. I saw the movie in its second weekend of play, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Positive word of mouth will likely result in continued strong business in the weeks to come. If you have any interest in car racing, or are simply interested in a well-made and entertaining movie (even if a bit overly long for its own good), I readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD or Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

7,"I'll come right out and say that cars are one of the least interesting things in the world to me (perhaps only behind The Royal Family, fashion, and reality TV). If a car has four wheels, starts, and can maintain the speed limit: I'm happy. So it's unlikely I would have gone out of my way to see a movie so heavily focused on making and racing cars had it not been for the cast, the solid track record of director James Mangold, and the positive reviews.On the topic of those reviews- I'm not as enamoured with the movie as many seem to be, but I find this movie relatively easy to recommend to anyone who's willing to give this movie 2.5 hours of their life. This running length is mostly justified- it's a fairly large story but I feel it could've ideally been 20-30 minutes shorter, and for all the hubbub The Irishman has been stirring lately because of its epic length... I feel like that one justified its running time more.So the length and the subject matter weren't ideal for me, but highlights did include Bale's performance (wasn't he hugely overweight less than a year ago for Vice? This guy's commitment to the physicality of the roles he plays is INSANE), the racing scenes (they're tense as all hell, especially if you're like me and don't know the actual history of the events depicted), and the sound design. This movie has a really good chance of sweeping the technical awards at this year's Oscars, the same way movies like Gravity and Mad Max: Fury Road have done recently.Give it a watch I'd say, even if you're not a car nut. If you have a great home theatre and sound setup it's not a must watch at the cinema, but if not, it's a good one to see on the big screen."
7,"The structure is neat, the rhythm is steady, the whole film is completed in one go, the racing part is even more breathtaking, and the ending is sigh and sigh. Adapted from real-life events, it tells the story of Ford Motor Company entering the racing market in cooperation with a car designer and a British race driver. The film can hardly be faulted. From the filming of the director to the acting of the actors, it can be said that everything is comprehensive. It is a very good biographical film. P.S. Junk Party A is not human! ! ! How can this be done! ! I'm furious! ! !"
7,"If at first you don't succeed: but are some things or careers or professions worth paying the ultimate price for?So often the case, then as now, the team makes the difference and the paymasters do their best to scupper it through folly and ignorance."
8,"When Justin Lin announced he would be stepping down as the director for Furious 7 following Universal's decision to fast track the sequel before the release of Furious 6, a lot of fans like myself were wondering who could possibly replace him!? The franchise wouldn't be what we've come to know without Justin, he has been around since the Tokyo Drift (which is way too under-rated) and saved the dying franchise from being released direct to video. Fast & Furious is never just about street racing but family & heist. Before you hate me, watch the first movie and Fast Five again then compare it yourself. You see the evolution of the characters and from robbing trucks with DVD players to heisting 100million. Now back to Furious 7.. When they announced James Wan will be taking over the franchise, a lot of us were worried as he was most well-known for his work in horror genre, particularly SAW & Insidious. Nevertheless James has proved he is perfectly capable of big budget action movies, just look at the air drop or the Abu Dhabi sequence!Spoilers ahead..The film started off with Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) talking to the coma-tonic Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), promising to avenge him. Just pause and think how he could have survived the fall from the plane!? If that's the case I think Gisele & Han can too.. I mean they did bring Letty back right?With all the hyped built up from the post credit scene of Furious 6, I was genuinely interested to see how Deckard Shaw hunt down the team and continue where Tokyo Drift left off. Instead we were introduced another villain, Mose Jakande, played by Djimon Hounsou (which is unnecessary and dull), Shaw was pretty much cast aside as a secondary character. We never get to see the team from the hunted to the hunter as Shaw kept showing up from time to time. Other than the impressive action sequence, it didn't really add much to the overall story. Sean Boswell played by Lucas Black showed up for 1 minute or 2 talking to Dom and you would at least think he might want to avenge Han right? But no we don't see him for the rest of the film.. I guess we just have to wait for the sequel. Shaw brothers might be teaming up, you never know!Furious 7 was originally intended to be the first of a new trilogy but plans were scrapped due to Paul Walker's untimely death and instead the filmmaker decided it was all about making this movie for Paul. A lot of moviegoers like myself were very emotional by the credit rolled. It felt like the end of the journey with these characters you come to love and it was the perfect send off to Walker's character, more importantly farewell to Paul himself. The crossroad scene is definitely the highlight of the film and the reason I am giving this an 8 out of 10.Part of me wishes they end the franchise here but with the highly impressive box office number, a sequel is nothing but guarantee. . I am very curious to see where the franchise is heading without the essence of Paul Walker. It just does not seem right without one of the core family member.. What do you think?"
8,"For the absolutely most part I really enjoyed this action movie. This is exactly the kind of action that I really like. Extreme action. Action that does not try to be ""realistic"" at all. Over the top action. (and I really hate people that can't accept extreme action, they be all like: ""yeah, right, that's SO unrealistic""! Dumb people.Here's what I don't like. I have to say I have a slight problem with Vin Diesel. I mean, he's alright, it's just, compared to Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, he's just, well he kind of pales in comparison. His character is also slightly annoying. With his family-talk all the god damn time. We get it, you're into family, the only thing that matters is family, your little gang is family. Family. Family. And hose gravelly grunts he speaks in, ain't cool bruh. Sometimes you can barely make out what he is saying.The movie also tries to portray him as super strong, which I don't totally buy. He's a big guy, but not that big. He looks like he thinks he's bigger than he is. Compared to the monster that is The Rock, he looks like a skinny twig for Petes sake. And he, Vin Diesel, is lifting cars and tossing people several yards, I just don't buy it.Also there's some other stuff that I didn't like. There's this ""computer chip"" with some insane technology, and it seemed a little out of place. That stuff was straight up sci/fi. I hate when they mix sci/fi-stuff into action movies that are set today. The plot has some issues, but I choose not to care too much.OK, got that out of the way. This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top-action. Several big, long action scenes, and I pretty much loved all of them. And since this is an action movie first and foremost, I won't let the negative stuff count all that much. I was very entertained.There are a couple of 'jump-out-of-a-car-in-slow-motion, at-the-last-millisecond, with-a-one-in-a-billion-chance-of-making-it'- scenes that for some reason gives me goosebumps a little. Probably because they are so over the top. I love that stuff. I think of who ever came up with something so over-the-top, and get a little impressed. Good job!Good thinking getting Jason Statham into this, I so rooted for him. He is way cooler than the whole furious-team.And that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous. And she speaks nineteen languages, including Dothraki, what a catch!And of course, we all know Paul Walker is no longer with us, and you're reminded of that each time he is on screen. He gets a little montage at the end, it is very well done - really sad, man. Real damn sad."
8,"Fast & Furious 7 was special for me because of two reasons. First, it is the last movie of the Fast & Furious series and second, it is Paul Walker's last movie. Paul died tragically in a car accident in 2013 during the movie break, leaving a huge void in the cast and in the hearts of his fans. This movie which was still in its production stage when he died, is a tribute to this great actor as seen throughout the film with its multiple references to ""One Last Ride"" and scenes in the graveyard where actors talk of loss, goodbyes and one last adventure together. There is a sadness and a sense of loss present all through the movie which speaks volumes about the place that Paul held in the hearts of his fellow actors who not only became his friends but also brothers. The end is a heartrending adieu to the actor and had me misty eyed and wishing Paul was still alive and well.Director James Wan of Insidious movie fame has taken up the director's chair in this movie and does an exceptional job of piecing it together while also managing to raise the entertainment bar. Nowhere was it evident that the movie had been cleverly edited for the scenes that were done after Paul's death. The movie entertains and excites with its superbly done stunts with flying cars and dangerous larger-than-life scenes. The acting is as usual memorable and it was great watching all our beloved characters coming to a final point in their lives.This movie is beautifully stitched with The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift and takes up from its ending. Jason Statham makes his presence felt in the role of a vengeful brother and his fights with Dom are memorable. Dwayne Johnson has a comparatively smaller role in this film but still is no less commanding and heroic. His catchy dialogues bring humour and the thrill of the breathtaking action to come. Ali Fazal of Fukrey fame also makes an appearance in the movie and manages to make us laugh in his very small role. All the actors complement each other and the acting flows fluidly with nowhere to show that all this is acting and not real!All in all, I loved watching Fast & Furious 7 and while it was hinted several times in the movie that this may very well be the last movie of the franchise but still I hope that we will get to see another Fast & Furious movie in the future. Go watch this entertaining film which is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.This review is also available on Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff"
8,"Fast & Furious has become a huge recognizable name in action, today it stands as a huge box-office hit for distributor Universal Studios. With this anticipated seventh installment, they have pulled out the big guns on action, fun and surprisingly emotion as the series reaches new heights and its trademarks that make it recognized.The film lifts off where the previous 6th outing left, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and crew are home in America having securing their amnesties and living their lives in peace with loved ones: with Toretto still helping his love Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) regain her memories and O'Connor adjusting to fatherhood to his growing son. But this peace will be shattered when one of their own is killed by the target cross-eye of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is avenging his brother's demise.James Wan may be known for his contributions to horror-thriller genre (Insidious, The Conjuring, Saw and Death Sentence) but his direction and view of an action genre film is indeed an strong impression that left me and audiences in excitement. Wan proves that action is driven on speed, choreography and style and this makes F&F7 a worthy example of this. The action sequences are all big, loud and pack plenty of eye candy for action fans; from a rescue mission on a moving bus, building jumping, shootouts, fistfights and an explosive climax that takes place in an urban city. Practical stunts, assisting CGI and well-choreographed eye on detail make F&F7 worthy contender for visual effects and stunt awards in the coming year.Casting as always is close and fun in the F&F series, with Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, Gibson, Bridges, Brewster and Johnson sharing the leading formula that makes their characters seem so likable, with Johnson, Russell, Hounsou, Emmanuel and Statham proving great supporting roles. But sadly here it is final acting appearance of the late Paul Walker (who had died in an unexpected event) which left the film in a stand-still and its cast and fans worldwide in deep sadness. The film was delayed for a year and a half but the result was something that would touch not only the audience but its crew and cast. The final scene indeed left people crying in the theater but it was a touching and emotionally connected moment that hasn't been seen in film in some years, it made me feel both sad and touched and feeling that the F&F series had ended perfectly as it won't be the same without Walker.Fast & Furious 7 is not only a fast driven action ride but in terms of quality, production value and emotion it proves to be the best of the series and one of this year's best films to have seen. It's only a thought now to see how Mad Max: Fury Road (releasing on May 14th 2015) will overthrow the action and car stunts that F&F7 has established a strong impression among audiences, but regardless this film will indeed be on your to 'see list'. Walker would have been deeply proud of how the film turned out in the end.4/5 – Nick & Jay"
8,"It's difficult to talk about 'Fast and Furious 7' or how it's billed 'Furious 7', without mentioning the tragic accident that cost actor Paul Walker his life back in November. This accident was not part of filming, but did drastically change the story line and halted production for quite a while. Walker had not finished filming his scenes, but you wouldn't know it, as the filmmakers used a combination of amazing CGI and stunt doubles to add him through the entire film. It's seamless and flawless in that aspect, and yes, there is a very moving tribute to him at the end of the film, which might cause you to choke back a few tears. I know I had too.It has been 14 years since the first 'The Fast and Furious' film graced our screens, and who would have thought that it would be the powerhouse franchise it is today. The first film back in 2001 cost $38 million dollars, which is pretty cheap for a big action film. Cut to today with 'Furious 7', the budget has gone up to $250 million and has added a string of A-List actors to this high octane world, including Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, and The Rock. Whether or not you've seen any of the 'Fast and Furious' films, you're going to have a great time with 'Furious 7′. Do these films have smart dialogue or lengthy story plots? No, but that's not the reason for seeing these movies. Instead, you get a treasure trove of fast cars, big explosions, fantastic actions sequences, and fun performances by each actor. 'Furious 7′ picks up right where part 6 left off, where an over-the-top villain who seems to be able to take on armies of people with his barehands by the name of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), is after the 'Fast and Furious' team for putting his brother in a vegetable state in a previous film.He has promised to kill each and every member of the team. Meanwhile, there is a security surveillance program called the 'God's Eye', which can tap into any satellite or camera and find anyone with in a matter of seconds that an underground branch of the FBI wants. This branch is run by Kurt Russell, who tells Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) to rescue the hacker who created the program (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a group of terrorists, which in turn they can find Shaw before he can kill them.I know, I'm exhausted after explaining that too. 'Furious 7′ spans a few different countries and an avalanche of multi-million dollar cars that would make James Bond excited in more than one way. Director James Wan ('Saw') has perfectly concocted one of the ultimate action films that uses fast cars, big guns, excellent fight choreography, and giant explosions to keep the 132 minute film keep its super fast pace. There are a few melodramatic moments from time to time, but it's done in a good way, so that we can grow closer to the characters. If you can get through the stinky cheese one-liners throughout, which make you laugh more than anything, you're going to have an excellent time here.On a side note, I'm so glad they added Thai film star Tony Jaa to this film. I've been waiting for him to show up in the US for so long, and I hope he is here to stay, because his fight choreography and talent is some of the best out there. Don't believe me? Check this clip out. 'Furious 7' keeps its laughs, charms and cameos flowing, and even though Paul Walker is gone, there is no sign of stopping this franchise, which is a good thing. Let it be said now, 'Furious 7' is the first big action film of the early summer. Go see it."
8,"One of the best action film that exists out there and definitely the best in the Furious series. With death defying stunts and terrific visuals, it is a match made in heaven for petrol-heads. From jumping cars off an aircraft to jumping between buildings in Abu Dhabi, it puts shivers down your spine! Rock pulling off his signature move to street fight between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham and yet one cannot get enough of the action. This is pure entertainment at its best. As if this wasn't enough, the tribute to Paul Walker in the end was emotional and the best thing about this film. He got a send-off that he deserved! Those last scenes cannot be emphasized enough upon. Overall it is the best action flick so far this year. ""Whether I'm a quarter mile away or halfway across the world, the most important people in the room are mi familia."""
8,"Furious 7 is a great addition to the Fast and the Furious series! It has all the great action and humor from the previous movies, but also has more character development and heart. The movie of course has its over the top scenes and cheesy dialog, but that is easily forgotten with the amount of fun you have with this movie. The cinematography is also much better in this movie, thanks to the new director James Wan. James wan gives you all the great moments from the last movies, but steps it up. The movie also handles Paul Walkers death in great way. He also has a tribute at the end of the movie. Furious 7 is an amazing time at the cinemas!"
8,"If you are expecting this movie to be realistic and logic, then you are making a huge mistake. Put it in your mind set that these peoples are video game characters/anime/superheroes and everything will start to make sense.I was somehow thought that this movie is going to concentrates more about Han's death and there's some interesting plot that leads to the event. But nope, thats not how it went as it pretty straight forward action movie with no surprising plot and twist.For the action, I could not imagine what would they brought after those tanks in the 6th movie. And I was not disappointed, free fall cars, tower to tower car jumping and the regeneration power of Dominic Toretto! Talking about the crazy stuff in the movie, how the heck Dom is not dead after he drives his car off the cliff? In every movie I see people is sure to die unless the get out of the car somehow. How the heck a Somalian terrorist get a military grade helicopter and a jet powered Predator drone? And how the hell a 23 years old hacker girl can just develops the God's Eye thats are so powerful that CIA become absolute? Seriously guys, you need to abandon the world's logic and watch this movie as if you are watching The Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Expecting this movie to be realistic and logic is a great mistake.As for the send off scene for Paul Walker, its truly an emotional moments in the movie. For the people who is not a fan to this movie or doesn't even know who Paul Walker is then they probably doesn't get it whats going on here. But for me, I barely holding my tears as I watch it. What a long journey it is~ For Paul"
8,I saw this movie a couple of days after it had been released. I have noticed over the years the Fast and Furious franchise has become more about the action scenes (especially Fast and Furious 6) than the actual cars and street races of the original Fast and Furious films which many of us love. Furious 7 creates a great balance of stunts and action whilst also focusing on the cars and the driving skills of the characters. I feel James Wan and the writers made the correct decision in not killing off Paul's character even though the plot had to be changed because of his unfortunate passing. The acting was up to it's usual good standard as in all of the movies. Great film 9/10. RIP Paul Walker
8,"The summer blockbuster season is just beginning and (for me) there could be no better film to kick it off with. From a franchise that seems perfectly suited for the 'popcorn movie' months ""Furious 7"" delivers all the fun, massively scoped action and excessive chaos that you could expect from two movies. The cast returns in what will be the last film for the late Paul Walker and as posthumous film appearances go, this was by far the most over-the-top and outrageously memorable send offs an actor could close with.The story-line is absurd and for the most part makes no logical sense throughout, but if you haven't learned by now to expect the monumental amounts of ridiculousness from this film franchise then you must have been in a coma for the last ten-years. Entering its seventh entry in the series, the 'Fast and Furious' franchise have done just about all you could think of as far as what a car can do in a stunt-sequence, yet as another film hits cinemas you can only sit back and enjoy the catastrophe and high-adrenaline action that only surpasses its predecessor.Yes the dialogue is what you could expect but regardless of its cheese-factor there are is enough bulk of a story-line to serve as a buffet for repeated eye-popping sequences with cars taking out helicopters, dropping from planes, launching out of massive skyscrapers and oh yeah, they still manage to add some great chase- sequences as well. This was something that was nice to see re- implemented in a franchise that seemed to forget where it started in the more recent films. Usually by this time in a franchise, entering its seventh installment, you could expect to feel the monotonous repetition of a possible stalling out. The ""Fast and Furious"" series only seems to be growing from each film and not only continuing to try and find creative ways to enthrall crowds with edge of your seat adventure, but manages to outdo itself with each new title. I am sure this film was much more hyped by the passing of Paul Walker last year and rightfully so, but even if he were still around this would have been a hugely popular movie among a massive target demographic and still held its solid blockbuster factor.The family moniker this film carries is enhanced with all the cast returning, as well as cameos from some of the fallen characters from the last film. The Dom/Lety triangle continues to evolve and even delivers a nice little Easter-egg during the perfect weekend for it as we learn more about what actually happened in the events of the past couple films between them. Paul Walkers role of family man is expanded and helps create a very respectful and fitting way to send his character off into the sunset with class and a homage to what he has done for this franchise. Jason Statham was a solid villain for this film but other than his fight scenes and routinely popping up conveniently all over the world, he still felt forgotten in the extremely busy script that pulls you from Los Angeles, to Tokyo to the Dominican Republic and Abu Dhabi. With Luke Evans from the last film getting more layers to his characters, despite the lack of physical prowess, was still the more entertaining villain simple from the conception of his character in the script. Djimon Hounsou was literally useless to the story-line and his addition only cluttered the already busy casting line-up. Kurt Russell was great and with his few moments in the film he was able to fit in with the younger characters with ease and effortlessly delivered his suave and intimidating 'Russellness' to the point I would have liked to have seen more of him.Statham's scenes with Diesel & Johnson were as visceral and rage filled as you could hope and Statham continues to show why he is the best in Hollywood regardless of being smaller then the men he is sized up against. Walker also had some very good scenes with Tony Jaa and the two showed great chemistry and worked to make some very impactful fight scenes that were good enough to say they slightly bettered those of Statham/Johnson/Diesel.While there were some good moments of hand-to-hand combat with some nice shots, the overall cinematography had its issues. The camera- work tried to pull the most out of the choreography putting you the viewer in the right spots at the right time without over- editing. But the tumble technique was highly over used. The camera spinning with the actors and even rolling to pull you into the action was over done. It was clearly noticeable in the Tony Jaa scenes where at times it was as if the camera couldn't keep up with the speed of Jaa while still trying to stick to the predetermined techniques. This film definitely didn't let just the guys have fun either. Michelle Rodriguez and Rhonda Rousey delivered a great fight scene as well. Both dressed in fine attire tearing room up they showed everyone that females can make up an excellent fight scene as well much like the Rodriguez/Carano subway fight from the prior film. Overall this one had a little bit of everything. From start to finish this film never stops or even (pardon the pun) tries to pull its foot off the gas. People will always laugh at movies like these but just as a Holiday biopic tailored for an Oscar nod, films like this have their place in cinema as well and the massive amounts of money they generate help fund many of those future projects."
8,"Amongst the hype of the death of the incredible Paul Walker, James Wan and his crew managed to pull off the brilliance that was the seventh installment of the Fast and Furious Franchise (Styled as Furious Seven.) On a whole, the franchise started out as a small-time, home-bound film regarding street racing and yet as it progressed, the franchise developed into an international action genre, that worked in favor for the films. For this one in particular, (Furious Seven) it was an excellent action-packed film peaked with fury and yet well-rounded off with a touching tribute in honor of a fallen comrade. And I guess that because these films taught the significance of family and substance in loyalty it was absolutely shattering as the movie came to end, signifying that so did the life and career of Paul Walker, and the legacy he left behind in the character of Brian O' Conner. On the other hand, in terms of screenplay and layout of the film, the special effects and action sequences were very much over the top bringing vast entertainment and a unique feel to the highly grossing and thrilling ride viewers take along with the cast. Rest In Peace Paul Walker."
8,"Review: WOW! What an epic action extravaganza! This movie was shockingly brilliant because of the unique stunts and decent storyline. Don't get me wrong, it is extremely corny in parts and the one-liners are pretty awful but the action scenes were out of this world. Anyway, the movie is about an assassin (Jason Statham) who is looking to take out the Fast & Furious team because they put his brother in a critically ill state in the previous movie in this franchise. After losing one of there team members to the assassin near the end of the sixth movie, they soon realise that there life's are in danger after a bomb explodes outside Paul Walkers family home. Dwayne Johnson also crosses the assassin in his office were he was looking for the names of the people who put his brother in hospital but the assassin came prepared and ended up hospitalizing the Rock, which put him out of action for most of this movie. This is when Kurt Russell enters the movie and offers Diesel a deal to take out the assassin who is ruining everyone's life's. The deal is to retrieve a unique tracking piece of technology from some terrorists, so they can track Statham down and take him out. The only problem is that the device is under high security so the team put a plan together which sends them around the world. The storyline was very well put together and the directors attention to detail was great. The amazing cars and stunts made this movie the 5th biggest movie of all time and I must admit, it is well deserved. You can definitely tell were the budget went whilst watching the film, especially when there in Abu Dhabi, crashing through buildings and blowing up expensive cars and the fighting scenes were truly a joy to watch. The ending nearly brought a tear to my eye because of the tribute to Paul Walker who died whilst making the movie but the director cleverly used all of the footage that he had of Walker so it seems like he's in the film from the beginning to the end. Anyway, this has to be one of the best films that I have seen this year because of the amazing action scenes and the great cast. Brilliant!Round-Up: I'm very surprised that this movie didn't cost more money to make because of the long action scenes which are put together brilliantly by the young director, James Wan. He was a weird choice to direct this movie because he has mostly worked on horror movies like the Insidious franchise, Saw, the Conjuring, which did scare me, Dead Silence and Death Sentence with Kevin Bacon. He really did bring something fresh to the Fast & Furious franchise which has made it one of biggest films of all time but the sad death of Paul Walker might bring a end to this profitable franchise. Paul Walker, 40, really became a household name after starring in the Fast and Furious movies but he had a couple of big screen successes like Into the Blue, Eight Below, Running Scared, Noel, Takers and Hours but none of these movies really pushed him to stardom. His great chemistry with Vin Diesel made the franchise what it is today, even though he was the quiet one of the bunch but he brought some emotion and the ""Family"" concept to the team which will be truly missed. Vin Diesel, 48, has really cut down his workload recently after starring in the successful Riddick in 2003 and voicing Groot in the Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014 but he hasn't released anything since. He does have another xXx and another Guardians of the Galaxy movie coming out next year some time and he'll be kicking of the Last Witch Hunter franchise this year so he's been keeping himself busy. Anyway, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham were excellent additions to the cast and I much prefer Statham as a baddie. I didn't quite understand what happened to Kurt Russell's character or why the special force team didn't help them towards the end but thats just me being picky. It is rumoured that there is going to be an 8th movie in this franchise, coming out in 2017 but anything can happen between now and then.Budget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $1.5BillionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/thrillers about the Fast & Furious team being hunted by a assassin after taking out his brother in the previous movie. 8/10"
8,"I've didn't see the first series of Fast & Furious, but I said I should give a try to see this movie. The movie is great for an usual action movie. There are lots of visual effects, great actors (Jason Statham, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodrigues, Vin Diesel and others), great cars, great ammunition. But what bothered me was that there are lots of destruction. Everywhere you see only destruction... Cars, houses, parking lots, asphalt etc. Maybe for other viewers this is not bothering, for me it was too much.I recommend viewing this movie especially for the series fans, actor fans and usual action movie fans."
8,"so with fast 7 came the biggest budget yet but also the biggest anticipation yet and the acting did not disappoint. The chemistry between the actors was near perfect and the film flowed well thanks to this. The use of Jason statham could have been better and Dwayne Johnson was also widely underused. The fighting scenes did become a little too fast at times to understand what they were doing and this scores against the film.Getting into the story and we know its going to be about furious toretto and fast cars but the story seemed a little lost sometimes in the need for more action and you find yourself thinking what is the need for this, a simple story got made complicated for no reason.Let me be honest, this film looked astonishing in what they pulled off, some of the scenes were edge of your seat fingernail biting worthy, this film is not about realism, its about coolness and the way some sciences played out were breathtaking.So overall this film has amazing acting, breathtaking scenes and offers you with amazing entertainment, definitely worth your money"
8,"Another fantastic entry in the 'Fast & Furious' franchise. The farewell scenes to Paul Walker are beautifully done, which also brings a star soundtrack from Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth."
8,"Just got back.Here is my short review:If you've been following the series from the start, watched it grow, seen how the cast have become a family you will absolutely love it.The tribute Paul at the end is poignant and very touching and will just cut you up.As for the film as a film, they action is crazier than ever, there's some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces.Statham is Statham – all that Transporter / War fight training is still present, Dwayne, missed you fella, always need more Rock.Kurt was fabulous , see how his role expands for 8 New chick is okay, guess she'll be promoted to regularBut this film was all about Dom and his relationships with Letty and Brian.The action, hey take it or leave it, call it stupid or enjoy it. The fights are absolutely amazing..But the character beats especially the last 10mins (Dom & Letty and the goodbye on the beach)..Tej as (Ludacris) and Roman as (Tyrese Gibson) were amazing and they had their moments..Everyone did a wonderful job! the stories in this series might be questionable but the character work and the relationships.. NOTHING comes close to matching The Fast and Furious FamilyThe ending had the entire theater crying.. RIP Paul"
8,"I've seen it today and I was blown away. It's truly action packed, filled with exotic and muscle cars, fight scenes etc. CGI of Paul was really good, which amazed me, since I feared it would look more like Terminator Salvation Arnold.Furious 7 is a movie worth watching because of excellent action scenes, great acting, good story and a lot of cameos for all the franchise fans. Even though I have to admit that quite a lot of action sequences seem unreal and crazy, you have to remember that this is fiction and a movie after all.There are also a few funny scenes and most of all a very nice send-off and tribute to Paul. The final scene brought tears to my eyes, which is a hard thing to do.R.I.P. Paul Walker, gonna miss you bro"
8,"Dom's family comes under threat from Deckard Shaw, the brother of the fellow they were up against in episode 6. Also, a mysterious government fellow pressures them to rescue a hacker who has invented a whizzo bit of kit which can spy on anyone on the planet.This series started out as rough, tough, cargasm movies, but it has gradually morphed via James Bond/Mission Impossible car-based action movies into, at this point, super-hero movies – Vin Diesel and Jason Statham both display levels of invulnerability which Superman would be proud of. If you thought the 25 mile airport runway in episode 6 was stretching things a bit, wait until you see what happens with the red car in this one. The action is absolutely preposterous, and highly entertaining, even if none of it makes any sense at all (the government seriously has no operatives that can do this kind of thing, so they have to recruit a bunch of freelance drivers to bale out of a cargo plane in their cars? Really?).Underwriting the whole thing is the knowledge of Paul Walker's death during production, necessitating rewriting and a variety of tricks to bring his character into scenes not filmed at that point. On the whole, this has been fairly well done, and there is little in the way of clunky moments when Walker's absence is obvious, which just leaves the awareness of his death and how that might impact on the story. Credit to the cast and crew for allowing the character to exit the series in a dignified and pleasing way, and for adding a moving coda by way of tribute which is dramatically fitting, thematically appropriate to the character and the saga, and full of obvious love for their lost friend and brother."
8,"The films belonging to The Fast and the Furious saga have been increasing the ambition of the stunts and action scenes with every new sequel, while the screenplays have been getting more tangled and apparatus in order to guarantee the numerous cast to have enough moments of individual showcasing. Furious 7 isn't the exception, and I found it very entertaining, while it elevated the level of drama and motoring stunts beyond any reason or logic... which is exactly what we expect in a film from this franchise. Besides, the sad death of actor Paul Walker's brings a gravity to the story which the screenplay could have never generated by itself. I think that, until now, I could found the validity in the wordiness about ""family"", which has been repeated many times by Vin Diesel in the films of this saga (I counted at least four instances in Furious 7). I wish that this new emotional weight hadn't been due to such tragic reasons, but it undoubtedly influenced my perception of the film. Anyway... what people want to see are the action scenes, and Furious 7 completely fulfills the expectations in that regard, with a series of outlandish stunts which are totally improbable but very entertaining. Screenwriter Chris Morgan found an appropriate balance between action and story, and director James Wan made a fluid and dynamic work. Editorial comment: the quantity and complexity of the stunts displayed in Furious 7 are making some people talk about the possibility of introducing a special category for stunt doubles at the Oscars; and I think that's an excellent idea. There's undoubtedly digital manipulation in those scenes (erasing of cables, face replacement, general retouch), but there's still an extraordinary mechanic, pyrotechnic and logistical talent involved in the shooting of those scenes, something which would deserve a formal recognition by the Oscars. There are currently two categories dedicated to the technicians who mix the audio of car crashes... and none to the drivers who risked their lives? Ridiculous. End of the editorial comment. The veteran actors of the saga do their usual stuff in Furious 7, as it can be supposed. As for the additions of the cast, Jason Statham makes a perfect work as one of the villains, but the great Djimon Hounsou is completely wasted as the terrorist who wants to steal a magical application of digital espionage. Kurt Russell brings an appropriate style and personality to his character. And the female fight scene between Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey is inferior to the similar ones in which Gina Carano was involved in the previous film. I don't know whether this saga is going to continue without Walker; it probably will, considering the huge quantities of money these films generate. My favorite movie from this franchise keeps being the fifth one (Fast Five), but I can recommend Furious 7 as a very competent action film, and as a solid tribute/final chapter in case they decide to stop here."
8,"""This time it ain't just about being fast.""James Wan, who is well known for directing horror films (The Conjuring and Saw), took over the seventh film in this franchise replacing Justin Lin who had been sitting on the director's chair since the third installment. What I found most interesting about this franchise is that it didn't seem like it was going anywhere after its solid debut in 2001 since the first couple of sequels focused on different characters and story lines. Even when they got the entire cast back together in 2009 for the fourth film I didn't feel like it was anything special. I'd always mildly enjoyed the films, but it wasn't until Fast Five that I was really engaged with the series. Justin Lin may have not impressed me before, but when that film came out he decided to have fun with the overblown action scenes and audiences embraced it completely. We had the team reuniting together being chased by tanks and planes and pulling off nearly mission impossible tasks. My greatest concern for this film was that Wan wouldn't follow that basic formula that had elevated the franchise in the first place. But in an early scene in the film those fears were soon gone when Wan practically gives the audience a wink by having Brian (Walker) telling his son that ""cars don't fly"" when he playfully throws a small toy car through the window. We were about to find out that that claim wasn't necessarily true because throughout this film we actually see several cars fly during the spectacular action scenes. By the end of Furious Six the franchise was tied perfectly together by uniting the events that took place in Tokyo during the third film with the present. In the fifth and sixth installments Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), Tej (Ludacirs), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) had finally found financial stability and cleaned their names to return home. The character of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) had helped reinvigorate the franchise and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was brought back from the dead (well actually she never really died, but fans of the franchise know what I mean). Mia (Jordan Brewster) and Brian were enjoying their newfound family life, but as we found out in the end of the sixth film, Owen's brother Deckard (Jason Statham) was set on avenging him. Their seemingly peaceful life is interrupted as the team begins to be hunted down by this dangerous British criminal. Loretto is offered the opportunity to flip the papers on Deckard from being hunted to becoming the hunters when a secret government official known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) offers him a deal. A Somalian mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) has kidnapped a hacker known as Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has developed a computer program known as God's Eye that basically allows you to find anyone across the globe in a matter of seconds. If Toretto's team can rescue Ramsey and retrieve God's Eye he will let them use it to track down Deckard and catch him off guard. And so the adventure across the globe begins with flying cars, helicopters and droids exploding across the mountains of the Middle East, the elegant buildings in Abu Dhabi, and the city of Los Angeles. Gisele and Han were part of the reason why I enjoyed the previous films so much so I was worried that their absence in this film would hurt the movie, but the addition of Jason Statham as the main villain of the film elevated this to a higher level. There are great fight scenes between him and Dwayne Johnson and then with Vin Diesel that were incredibly entertaining. These are probably the best action stars of our generation and when the fighting choreography is filmed correctly you can't go wrong with these guys. There are also some fantastic action scenes involving fast car chases across a gorgeous mountain that ends in a Jurassic Park like cliffhanger. The action scenes are overblown, but that is what makes them so entertaining once you learn to accept the absurdity of it all and simply enjoy the ride. Over-the-top action scenes is what elevated this franchise in the first place and Furious 7 continues to play with that same premise taking advantage of Wan's knowledgeable work behind the camera and his use of different camera angles which makes the film look all the more entertaining. The greatest success of Furious 7 is being able to blend the incredibly fun action scenes with the dramatic elements involving the chemistry between the characters. We've grown to love these characters and each new addition always seems to work. Furious 7 takes some common themes from films like Mission Impossible or Ocean's Eleven and applies them really well here. Tyrese Gibson plays a similar character to the one Matt Damon played in Ocean's where he wants to prove his leadership qualities to the rest of the crew. There are elements recycled from other action films, but thanks to the cast it works extremely well in this franchise. And then you have the emotional aspect of this film surrounding Paul Walker's untimely death. You can't help but feel emotionally engaged towards his character knowing that the actor has recently passed away. There are several scenes of his face where the CGI seems evident, but the voice work was perfectly executed. The CGI never distracted me however, and I'm glad they decided to continue with the production of the film. The last five minutes are emotionally engaging and without spoiling the film all I can say is that the crew did him justice with a beautiful tribute. Furious 7 continues to build on an already engrossing franchise and it might just be my second favorite after Fast Five. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
8,"The opening of Fast and Furious 7 unleashes Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw upon the screen, the older brother of Owen (Luke Evans), the lead antagonist from the previous feature. The power exhibited during this opening however is seldom felt again, and despite Mr Statham's astounding capabilities, the script inhibits his quality to the extent that he is generally about as threatening as a pebble in one's shoe.Upon Deckard igniting his quest for vengeance against Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), and the other individuals involved in hospitalizing his brother, by killing Han (Sung Kang), Toretto, who, as always, is marvelously portrayed, finds himself outmatched. A man with the alias Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), a high ranking CIA operative, who is as suave as he is cool, approaches him. Tasked in removing Deckard, Mr. Nobody provides Toretto with an opportunity to get out in front of his opponent with a device called God's Eye, capable of hacking into all video surveillance devices and utilizing them to find anyone in the world. Unfortunately, the creator of this software, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) has been abducted by terrorists, and as any action by America would constitute an international incident, alternate means are necessary for a safe extraction - enter Toretto and his crew. With the device, they will be able to track Deckard - however, like any film, it is never that simple.Unfortunately, this particular plot seems awfully redundant. Returning to the 'pebble in one's shoe' reference, Deckard continuously shows up at every confrontation to acquire his pound of flesh - basically, Toretto needn't fly halfway across the world for some gadgetry - he could just plant himself on a park bench and wait half an hour for Deckard to come to him. True, the storyline makes for some outstanding car sequences: ploughing through trees while crashing down a cliff; cruising through a luxurious suite on one of the topmost floors of a tower; racing down the streets of Los Angeles with a Predator drone in tow, among others, are all fantastically executed, though none of it feels to have been a legitimate requirement. Moreover, almost all of the action scenes require suspension of disbelief, the fact the characters are capable of surviving some of the incidents being highly suspicious.The banter exhibited between Tyrese Gibson as Roman, and Ludicrous as Tej, is as humorous and witty as it was in the previous installment, if not even more entertaining, the few stunts Tej becomes involved in really accentuating his character's persona. Even Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has more than a few memorable one-liners, despite his small role, and the inclusion of Eden Estrella as his charmingly enjoyable daughter Samantha, adds further depth. However, it is Michelle Rodriguez as Letty, whose performance is the most outstanding. A conversation between her and Toretto at the beginning, where she reveals the heart-wrenching pain of being crippled by amnesia, sets the scene for her character's journey, and lines she admits towards the end of the feature are beautifully impacting.The tribute at the feature's end to Paul Walker is very touching, and the words Mr Diesel says are as brotherly as they are passionate. During the film, Mr Walker seems to have less screen time as Brian O'Connor than he had in previous movies. Any digital superimposing that was promulgated to complete his role in the movie was amazingly established, Brian's story focusing on whether he would dedicate himself to living with Mia (Jordana Brewster) and their son, as a father who drives a mini-van (one of the film's most comically painful scenes), or continue to involve himself in fierce confrontations.Despite Deckard been largely alone in his plot for vengeance, other antagonists are portrayed by the unmistakable Tony Jaa, who participates in a number of amazingly choreographed fights, and the always impressive Djimon Hounsou, as terrorist leader Jakande. Respectively, both actors received limited roles, and deserved more screen time, especially considering Mr. Hounsou's presence can equally rival Mr. Diesel's. Towards the end of the feature, it is annoying that Jakande is only capable of saying 'what?' almost a dozen times as his plans are individually and irreparably torn asunder, while the vendetta he has against Toretto is as immature as it is unnecessary.The musical score strongly resembles the former films, which assisted in immersing this feature in the franchise, and though, for the most part, the movie flowed gloriously, it was towards the end that the film began to feel unnaturally forced, the conclusion to the final battle being as anti-climatic as it is predictable. Too many coincidental moments flooded this movie, in which a protagonist arrived at the right moment to save another hero, while at the same time, unanswered questions, like, how a group of terrorists, armed with sophisticated technology, managed to make it onto American soil undetected - leave notable holes in the plot.For the most part, entertainingly, characteristically and emotionally, Fast and Furious 7 delivers on all fronts, with impressive visuals, action-packed scenarios, well executed humor, tension and drama. It is unfortunate the villains, who were equally superb, did not receive the same attention, and it is further unsatisfying that the concluding battle seems to crash and burn, much like some of the damaged vehicles."
8,"With stellar reviews already, Furious 7 is set to be the largest hit for the Furious franchise yet; and rightfully so. This movie masterfully displays just how deep the values of family and honour are embedded within the Furious characters. Paul Walker is fantastic in his last ever movie, alongside Vin Diesel and new addition Jason Stratham as the movies antagonist; this movie really deserves to be seen. Fan or not, there is no denying that Furious 7 will take you on a roller-coaster of a ride; emotionally and visually, culminating in the best, most enthralling Furious movie to date which will live on in fans' hearts forever."

8,"The first scene didn't feel right ,also some scenes didn't need to be done , but the things that were right were really good. I would still recommend someone to watch this. i would give this a 8.5 or 8.0. Some people say 6 was better but i didn't like 6. If you like cars flying, things blowing up then this is a movie for you. The best role was played by Jason Statham. Some you might agree. Some of you will disagree. Overall, this one last trip as Torretto calls it, is refreshing, bang on and full out spectacular. Furious 7 deserves to be watched. I hope you like this review . If not tell me why. The end scene when brain and dom go on separate roads and the song 'when i see again' comes on."
8,"""Furious 7"" is the latest in ""The Fast and The Furious"" Franchise, whose production was halted due to the tragic death of Paul Walker, who played the co-lead, character of ""Brian O'Conner"" in the series, along with Vin Diesel's ""Dominic Toretto"". Reportedly less than half of Walker's scenes had been completed at the time of his passing. Through digital magic, Walker's two brothers, who closely resemble him, stepping in for him at points in the film, and re-writes, production then resumed, and now the film, Walker's last – is out. I hadn't seen one of movies at the time of I heard of Walker's passing. I watched all the previous shortly thereafter. While there are flaws, some cheesy Dialogue at times, etc., the movie to me are just guilty pleasures, simply meant for fun – And I really like or love each one. ""Furious 7"" is no different. Car chases,fight scenes, laugh out loud moments from Tyrese Gibson as ""Roman"" in particular, the theme of family, and Kurt Russell's ""Mr. Nobody"" is a great addition. Yes, there are some unbelievable moments, but it's fun, and you don't care. Without spoiling it - The exit for Walker's character is handled with class as reported. Will there be more? There is one aspect that is left open-ended, and the plan was for 10. I predict there will an 8th, or they will spin-off Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's character of ""Hobbs"", as has been a past rumored, and pick up that story line that was left open in that film. For this movie, a wonderful legacy for Paul Walker, May he rest in Peace – 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars – 8 1/4 out of 10 Stars."
8,"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it."
8,"This movie answers this question...what will the Joker be if he was a real life character ? A great deep and moving story, a life journey of a man who's suffering from some psychological issues and how neglect, bullying and rudeness by other human being can push a man to complete madness.Although it's not accurate to any comic book adaptation or any TV series or movie before it, yet it's a fresh and unique take on the character of the clown prince of crime from a realistic approach and I believe with Joaquin Phoenix amazing performance as the Joker in which he managed to bring a real life look-alike early version of the Joker which although is not comic book accurate but I feel it's a very decent foundation for Joker 2 which should be more true to heart of the original version of our lovable villain.The movie is over all a great piece of filmmaking in all of its aspects. From the plot which was very interesting, believable and many can relate to it, through the acting which was impressively splendid to the directing which was outstanding. My main take on the movie is the lack of any positive lead character, I know we live in a tough world which full of negativity but there are some positive examples here and there and to shed some light on one or two characters in this movie would've been a nice positive thought.The Joker movie can be misunderstood by many thinking it'll inspire crime and violence but I believe on the contrary that many who go through hard life will feel sympathy for the Joker character, others will even relate to his misery and may justify his actions. I believe the movie is meant to be a wake up call for many! A lot of people daily suffer from bullying, racism, hate crimes or neglect and sometimes they go through worse, we should take a deeper look at our actions and know that - aside from money and authority - we are all equally humans, we should treat one another the same way we expect to be treated."
8,"To say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading. Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it."
8,"This movie shows the true origin of the joker that has never seen before in cinema. I went in expecting non-stop action. But I was wrong, it is more subtle and takes important aspects from the source material. JP's acting is incredible and the trans-formation from Arthur to the Joker is portrayed remarkably well. The laugh he makes added with a great selection of sound and style of the movie makes it that much creepier. You sort of feel sympathy for Arthur and what he's been through even though, he is committing terrible acts of violence. There is elements of dark comedy which blends well with his character. The plot is strong and the director has done a very good job. This stand-alone movie pays great tribute to previous installents and will be go down as one of the best DC movies ever made."
8,As expected Joaquin Phoenix has done a fantastic job. Todd Phillips as director delivers a rounded film. The support from Director of photography and the music seals the deal.Story is a bit weak and lacks a punch that's expected from an iconic character as Joker. Joaquin's performance does cover up that but it's still pretty evident. Worth a watch
8,The acting of Joaquin phoenix is absolutely mind-blowing in this movie you should watch it. It is obviously a Oscar winning role and acting.
8,"Considering that previous joker films have been great to excellent, this movie had big shoes to fill. There's a certain level of anxiety and awkwardness with this movie, which is what is needed. You can see Phoenix's character almost hitting his breaking point in multiple occasions and when he finally does, it is enthralling"
8,"This tale of Joker's descent into madness has legitimate pathos. Joaquin Phoenix here is not charismatic, but sad and pathetic-not in the derogatory sense of the word, but in the sense of appearing skinny, having a cruel neurological condition, and being constantly misjudged, and in deserving pathos, or our sympathy. Sometimes, it did seem like this world of this newly created Joker struggled to fit with the comic book character we know from the Batman franchise. While Joker's slow burn into violent activity was believable, it was less believable that the same descent could lead him into becoming a super villain. Joaquin's Joker doesn't seem to have much agenda for the grand scale. His violent actions are all personal and reactive. This Joker falls into becoming a symbol for a protest movement, which doesn't feel quite a product of Gotham but of hasty scriptwriting. The film does its best to mix outcast themes, clown imagery and mental illness all in one to create the Joker, but something more than clown makeup is missing from the equation.""Joker"" is an uncomfortable and magnetic film. It uses several kinds of storytelling devices to disorient our sense of reality, sometimes successfully and other times not completely enough. Its use of soundtrack is compelling but also less than fully consistent. The era of the when the film occurs confuses itself between the 40s, the 60s, the 80s and the present 2000s. The soundtrack is pulled from a variety of these decades as well, and adds to that feeling of disorientation. The Batman franchise spans these decades, so gives meaning to their reference, but also warps the viewers frame of reference in assessing the important themes of the film. Is there a reason most of the social workers Alex Fleck/Joker encounters are black? Is this a statement of some kind, or a metaphor for projection, or just part of the demographic of the time?Anyway, not to overshadow the fact that this is a movie dealing with complex psychology of an unsettling but humane kind, and that this film that makes viewers uncomfortable somehow remarkably landed a wide audience and mass acclaim. Well, not remarkably. Any Batman movie would. But that this movie got made is quite a feat.While this movie isn't anything about incels (it's not a movie about perpetual virginity or anything 2000s, I think), it is probably the one movie most having to do with the fear of violence modern society has for those it has outcast. With this film I think it's possible to have more empathy than fear. However, there are some problematic messages that comes up by meshing together a story of an isolated, troubled, but rather ordinary person with a desire for simple joy, and that of a uniquely celebrated anarchist super-villain like Joker. These two characters don't quite relate, and perhaps shouldn't."
8,Story was interesting but nothing new and certainly not Oscar Worthy. Phoenix's performance was though!
8,"I'm still unsure about this movie - yes it was good, the acting was superb, but was this Joker really as good as Ledgers? I don't know. Over all I will probably have to watch this again just to give a final verdict, but Yes this Joker version is definitely better than the Suicide Squad version, how that got put in to a movie I'll never know! Still well worth a watch."
8,"Started off a little slow, but it was all important for the development of the Joker. Loved this movie and Phoenix has definitely earned all of the praise. The ""statement"" of this movie is loud and clear and I think it needs to be heard by as many people as possible."
8,It's very good movie however the only mistake I see that the joker age shouldn't be that old as not have great age difference between Batman and the joker
8,"Heavy! It is one of those pieces that come around every so often and makes you take a deep look @ yourself. This is not a wild and fun version of the character. This is an introspective take into mental illness and how we as a people choose to relate to it. You will leave this movie ashamed or proud of how you relate to others. Fantastic acting. Fantastic setting. Emotional to say the least. Is Phoenix's rendition of #TheJoker superior to Heath's, it's not inferior. #movies #moviecritic"
8,"A great, raw pic describing the origins of the Joker. Although, the homage is greater to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' than to any Batman movie.A visceral exploration of mental illness and a deep character study facilitated by an emotional and convincing performance by Phoenix.Overall, very much enjoyed the original take, aided by cohesive storytelling and fantastic performances. Only detracting factor was homage sometimes swayed into plagiarism with remarkable similarities to Taxi Driver. While the film felt like a win for original storytelling it may also have been another victim to Hollywood's plague of remakes and sequels masked by a thin vineer of apparent uniqueness .Worthwhile watch in 2019!"
8,"Amidst all the controversy and thoughtless comments from its director that threaten to overshadow the film itself, Joker is a brutally pointed and thrilling film that seeks to deviate from the comic book mold, all the while staying religiously true to its trademark qualities.though it is, in parts, ladened with the overbearing need to fulfill the requirements for an inevitable franchise (see: some of the thomas wayne arc), Joker is an intriguing character study that actually scratches the thematic surface so-to-speak, glossing its plot over with a depth that many comic book films struggle for.and at its core is the clown himself! if Heath Ledger's Joker was a portrait of a psychopath standing out in a society that was conceptually good, then Joaquin Phoenix's take on the role is a victim borne of the very perversion that he seeks to revenge. Phoenix is chilling and nuanced, capping his performance off with an odd innocence that is terrifyingly memorable.much of the criticism garnered by the film is well-deserved, as its thought-provoking message begins to get lost in the violence in the third act. it is, after all, a super hero flick. but the quick need to dismiss the film is wholly unwarranted. Arthur Fleck doesn't even become Joker until the final half-hour of the film - for the majority of its runtime, he is a broken man living in a society that's failed him.its overall commentary is poignant and rich, maybe even a little too on the nose, and it begins to get needlessly gruesome as Todd Phillips (his direction being the weakest aspect of the film by the way) strives to drive home his point. whether it serves as a source of empathy for mass murderers or not is a matter of subjectivity, though i agree that the violent end-all approach it takes cripples its overall effect. nevertheless, Joker is a solid film that shows that comic book films can have meaning."
8,"You see, hear and feel this film like you rarely do any film."
8,"When this film was announced, my initial thought was ""no one can come close to rivaling Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker in 'The Dark Knight'."" Let me tell you: Joaquin Phoenix give a phenomenal performance in ""Joker"" it'll be the biggest snub in Oscar history if he doesn't get nominated; he really dug deep for this one. As far as how it compares to Ledger's performance, it does, and it doesn't. It does because both will be talked about for years and will be considered some of the best performances in cinematic history that transcend any comic book movie portrayal by a long shot. Neither actor dialed in their performance; they each put the time and effort into making a unique interpretation of the character, which leads to the part where I mentioned that they don't compare because each version of the character are polar opposites of one another as far as their motives. Ledger's version was an agent of chaos; there was no reasoning behind his actions, he didn't have a clear backstory (it was multiple choice); he was just a guy that wanted to watch the world burn, and he portrayed that to perfection. Meanwhile, Phoenix's version, suffered from a mental illness all while being treated unfairly in life. We're taken through a series of tragic events through Arthur's perspective, that eventually push him over the edge and lead he to become the ""Clown Prince of Crime""; that was portrayed to perfection as well. Side Note: Robert De Niro was great too; even with the limited amount of screen time he had, he nailed the talk show host persona.The film itself is a SLOW burn. It's more of a character driven film that takes it's time to show you everything that happens in the titular characters life, which leads up to a BRUTAL finale. It's because of amount of breathing room this film has, it won't be for everyone; if you're expecting the usual, run-of-the-mill comic book film with tons of fighting scene, guns and explosions, you'll walk out severely disappointed. This is more of a drama/character study that lets you into Arthur's mind but once the chaos starts...OH BOY!!!!.The movie was shot really well; Todd Phillips made some great choices in this film from a direction standpoint; the lighting, certain scene transitions, zoom in/out shots were all terrific. I wouldn't mind seeing Phillips tackle more films like this one. Overall, Phoenix's performance alone was worth the price of admission; he was THAT good; however, as I stated earlier, the film takes a long time to develop, which I usually don't mind because I'm a very patient movie watcher, but if there comes a time where I'm thinking: ""that's been established, we can move on"" that's when I know they're taking a little too long and unfortunately, I had that thought a few times throughout. The good thing is the ending is really good and really established how Gotham became the chaotic, crime-ridden city we all are accustomed to and it shows why Batman is needed..."
8,"Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his performance in this movie..But the movie hadn't reached what was expected from it.
Tod Phillips did an excellent work in directing but this movie has what's called typically lazy writing..How can be murdering 3 random guys who happened to be working for Wayne interprises in a subway train by an anonymous guy wearing a clown mask be a spark for a revolution and riot?..The killer didn't even know them or what they were working.. The question is why people consider him a hero and a symbol for their riot?..Why they even criticize Thomas Wayne for sympathizing with them?.. It was an attempt to make the movie darker and the atmosphere of this society so dark but It failed.
Also considering the movie R-rated was just another propaganda from Warner Brothers..the violence scenes in the movie aren't that savage..there's no so offensive words and no reason for Rating it as R.
The 2 hours runtime for the movie was short for the events and the story..this movie deserved at least extra 20 minutes to give its best.
The movie is a mixture between Taxi Driver and V for Vendetta so there's not so much creativity in the idea of the movie.
Most of the movie is a buildup to be joker..It's not like any comic book movie..It's more about depression and psychology.
The joker here has no plan no purpose the filmmakers make the people use him as a symbol not a leader for the riot.
Finally..Being a psycho or a failure or abandoned by society or having bad time doesn't give you the right to kill people who bother you and cause chaos"
8,"It's not a 10/10. If you watch the trailers you can some what predict where the films going at a certain point. Great supporting cast especially if you are a fan of standup. The cinematography is great. Joaquin Phoenix can do anything. Without Phoenixs performance, the film might not of been able to pull the complex turns with the character in the way that was needed. I got the sense that he carried the movie and for the most part, kept it from collapsing on itself."
8,Good look into the psychological development of the joker.. not a movie for those looking for an action packed film.
8,"In an uncharacteristic masterstroke, Todd Philips (director of Road Trip, The Hangover Trilogy and War Dogs) presents a unique take on the Joker by infusing the real-world tragedies of familial breakdown, abuse, neglect and mental illness into his story arc with sociopolitical unrest and social incivility as a backdrop. In doing so, Joaquin Phoenix's immersive performance gives heart and horror to the underlying nihilistic impulse to ""watch the world burn"" that was missing in the more intellectual ""concept personified"" interpretation by Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger.While its a sad, violent plunge into psychotic madness may hit home too hard for some viewers, Todd Philips' Joker is a refreshing for its fresh approach that abandons its franchise trappings or Hollywood studio conventions to do something bold and socially relevant despite the gross misinterpretation of critics who think their socially-aware politicos."
8,"Who is the crazier one?
The one who is able to adapt without contradiction to the conditions of a cynical, violent and morally corrupt time, or the one reacting on those conditions with uncompromising insanity, fighting back, using his own weapons of revenge, reflecting world's madness with an insane grimace?
This is the disturbing question the film poses in the figure of The Joker, equally fascinating, frightening and pitifully embodied by Phoenix, an unforgettable performance with great depth and a wide range of emotions: a Travis Bickle for the 21st century, and Robert De Niro himself paying tribute to this 43 years later after his own legendary performance in Taxi Driver."
8,"Gotham City. Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is also an aspiring stand-up comic. He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.Great drama. While the movie fits into the Batman universe, and this could easily be seen as a prequel to Joker's character in The Dark Knight (where Joker was played superbly by Heath Ledger), this is not a comic-book movie. If it was a comic-book movie, it would have ended up another one in a long, seemingly endless line of them, one hardly discernible from the next.No, this is a human/psychological drama, and a very good one. Writer-director Todd Phillips creates a dark, depressing world with Arthur Fleck one of its primary casualties. The slow, inevitable progress of Arthur Fleck from innocent man to master-criminal is an interesting journey as Phillips rachets up the tension.What was then required was a performance that captured that darkness, helplessness and gradual disintegration and Joaquin Phoenix gives that, perfectly and spectacularly. Spot-on casting and delivery.Not quite the perfect movie though. Pacing was a bit off: some scenes seem dragged out too long. I know Phillips was drawing it out to create tension and atmosphere, but on a few occasions it feels like he overdoes it.It is also difficult, from a point, to be sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck. You start out supporting him, feeling that he is a victim rather than a villain, but, as his actions become more extreme, that engagement wanes.The story also feels like it is missing something to make it 100% complete. No, I'm not expecting this to link in with The Dark Knight. In fact, many of the Batman references actually seemed unnecessary, more there for audiences to gasp and say ""Oh, so that's how Joker fits in with Batman"", rather than adding anything to this story. A few scenes beyond the final scene might have been in order, to see more of Joker's history.Overall, still a great movie though."
8,Omg one of the best dc films out there blew my breath away. The performance of all the characters were outstanding and I love the twist and turns
8,Great. Awesome performance . Directing perfect acting from all actors perfect but the movie over all is not that much of thriller or idont know may be i wanted more but it really needed more.
8,"I've seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.And now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.Thinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I'm well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.And boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.Shelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he's still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he's never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn't want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.Henry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,"" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn't want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, ""You're only Henry Ford the second, you'll never be Henry Ford."" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.Cars represent man's desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man's way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film's absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.Ford v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment."
8,"To start off, I have always hated racing. Yes, hated. It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.To finish off; I am STILL not interested in cars or racing, but this film stands on its own even so."
8,"You have to have a big dump in your pants if all you're gonna do is complain about ""historical inaccuracies"" of a movie. Extremely entertaining film. Great cast, fun movie. Bale crushes it per usual."
8,This movie is so energy-filled action-packed emotionally-thrilled that engages you and begs for your attention in every single scene. Christian Bale gives yet another brilliant performance and so does Matt Damon and the entire cast. A movie not only for car enthusiasts but for everyone to enjoy.
8,"Nice surprise at the Cineworld secret screening with this. Bale and Damon have great chemistry. I struggled with Bale's UK Northern accent occasionally, but a story of risk, achievement and friendship, with some great driving scenes. Would recommended, especially for any race fans.
8/10"
8,Ford vs Ferrari... Great movie to respect Ken Miles. One of the greatest road racers ever.
8,"Le Mans '66 is a fast paced thrill ride from beginning to end. It tells the story of how carol shelby and ken miles built a car that could beat Ferrari in 24hr race at Le Mans where they had won the previous 4 years. The biggest strength in this film is the chemistry between the cast, good performances all round from Josh Lucas to Ray McKinnon but the whole film hinges on the chemistry between the two leads. it delivers on that front with the highlights of the film being scenes with Damon & Bale genuinely feeling like two old friends bantering back & forth about cars. Matt Damon does a great job as Shelby but can't help be overshadowed by Christian Bale who steals the movie with his performance as ken miles a man on the journey to find that one perfect lap. James Mangold does a good job with the direction you feel the gear shifts & the tension when the Ford Gt40 screeches it's breaks around right corners. There could probably more ambitious or creative shots in some of the races but in my honest opinion I think the performances Mangold got out of this cast outshines the technical stuff. The writing isn't the best and can come off as cheesy & predictable in certain areas but for the most part I felt it was well written and had a good pace to it. I'd recommend Le Mans '66 it's not 1st place but it's a near perfect lap."
8,"Shellby is leading the Le Mans where he is focused, determined and one could easily hear his heartbeat and hot breath in a fading raving engine sound mastered by a genius sound editing. The future is not too bright for Miles Ford and Ferrari but unlike Miles he does not hold the cards in life.. When people in high places determine people's fate, trusting a friend who is controlled by such is not that easy. But the Miles-Shellby bond is a prime example of great casting. In the end, your fate is determined by people in suits; mirroring why unchecked heights of inequality can determine people's fate in our this era. The tragedy of Miles losing his life was not the awful end to such a great picture but how weak dialogue and script diluted an already bubbling 120mins of great acting and powerful zoom-ins."
8,"Based on A.J. Baime's Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by Jason Keller, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth, and directed by James Mangold, Le Mans '66 (released in North American with the equally generic title of Ford v Ferrari) counts Michael Mann as an executive producer. This is notable, as Mann himself has been trying to bring an adaptation of Brock Yates's Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races (1991) to the screen since at least 1993. Indeed, at one point, Mann's Enzo Ferrari was set to star Christian Bale, before he was replaced with Hugh Jackman. Whether or not it will ever be made is open to speculation, but it seems unlikely in the wake of Mann's involvement with Le Mans '66, an excellently made but unadventurous movie.Mangold is a fine director, but he's no Mann, nowhere near, and the film did, to a certain extent, leave me pondering what kind of kinetic brilliance Mann would have brought to similar material. In contrast to Mann's body of work, Le Mans '66 could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything especially original - it hits all the beats, it hits them well, but it never strays from the formula. Looking at issues such as friendship, male pride, personal integrity, sticking it to the Man, art v commerce, individuals v corporations; it is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteur theory audience-pleaser made with the technology and aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. And whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is unexpectedly accomplished and immensely enjoyable.The film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) wins that year's Le Mans, only to be told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. Cut to 1963, and Henry Ford II (a superb Tracy Letts, who steals every scene he's in) has just had an offer to purchase Ferrari rejected and been personally insulted by Ferrari himself (Remo Girone). Livid, Ford II determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, which Ferrari has won in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Ford Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) contacts Shelby, the last non-Ferrari driver to have won the event, and asks him to design a car. He gets to work but says they'll need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. He reaches out to Ken Miles (Bale), who has a reputation as one of the best drivers in the world, and is renowned for his almost supernatural ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his volatility and unpredictable personality, few want to work with him. He comes on board, but immediately clashes with the Ford executives, particularly Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).Le Mans '66 is somewhat similar to Michael Mann's Ali (2001), insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story - Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans '66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don't see value in anything unless it's monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular (we'll ignore the fact that the whole thing feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to hit as many clichéd feel-good moments as possible).The film is also extremely funny in places, especially in a scene where Shelby shows up at Miles's house, and the two get into a fight on the street. Miles's wife Mollie (an underused Caitriona Balfe) emerges from the house, looks at the two men fighting, goes back inside, and remerges with a garden chair, a drink, and a copy of Better Living. She then sits down to watch the action. It's a hilarious moment, but it's one with great thematic importance - this is very much an androcentric world (Mollie is virtually the only female in the entire film), but for this brief moment, the audience is allowed to pull back and laugh at the utter ridiculousness of competitive maleness - boys will be clichéd boys, always trying to outdo each other, and getting all worked up over something as pointless as a fast car.This thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there's a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, although thematically, the focus isn't on the races themselves, there's no denying that the aesthetic design of these scenes is exemplary, albeit familiar. Mann would have done wonders here, but Mangold, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, and sound designers David Giammarco and Jay Wilkinson have crafted some truly intense moments. For the most part, Mangold and Papamichael avoid any objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see. The scenes aren't shot in the first-person, but our vision is anchored to his. This, of course, contributes to a subjective focalisation and creates the sense of being in the car with him, which brings a default level of intensity, as well as giving the viewer a perfect vantage point from which to see just how fast these guys are going and how difficult what they do actually is.In terms of problems, there are only two of significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn't anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn't say anything we haven't heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path - chances are that everything that you think might happen in Le Mans '66 does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. The character of Beebe is a good example of just how rigidly. In essence, he's a poorly written token villain because you can't have an underdog story without a token villain (usually in the form of bureaucratic interference). In this case, when Mangold feels the need to inject some conflict into proceedings, Beebe will pop up to throw a wrench into the works. His motivation? Apart from some brief references to how he doesn't think Miles is a ""Ford man"", his antipathy is never explained - the character is a Swiss army knife villain who can be used for multiple purposes, a one-size-fits-all bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby himself, who is disappointingly one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life - for example, the film makes no reference to the fact that by 1963 he was on wife number three (of seven!). Who is the film's Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer - he's Matt Damon wearing a Stetson and speaking with a Texas drawl. And that's about all the character development he gets.Although these issues are significant in isolation, the thing about Le Mans '66 is that it's so well made, it rises above the clichéd and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is very much more than the sum of its parts. A film about friendship and integrity rather than racing, it doesn't take any risks, nor does it bend any rules. Indeed it does nothing that could be labelled innovative. For all that, however, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It won't surprise you, it probably won't move you, it certainly won't change your life, but the storytelling is clear and refined, and the journey is one well worth taking."
8,"Not a massive fan of motor racing or motor racing movies but i did enjoy this.
The major asset for the film is the cast, Matt Damon is very good but the real star of this is the fantastic Christian Bale, a superb performance from a great actor.
The story of an unsung British hero, a very modest and a very real hero, he did really drive a tank in WW2, is a tale very much worth telling.
It is long bit flies by - go see."
8,"It 's not a god, but it 's a movie I love so much emotionally. The Ken Miles shaped by Bell is such a perfect character, is a master of thoughts, and the loss of the world will not pollute him. He doesn't need to prove anything to anyone."
8,"You don't have to be a race car enthusiast to enjoy this film. I'm certainly not, having neither the desire or the patience to watch daring motor cars race around a track at mind boggling speeds. Though you do have to credit the drivers who enjoy the profession; it takes a certain amount of bravura and stamina to withstand the pace and stress forces that go with the territory. Without knowing the story in advance, I thought it was going to pit Matt Damon against Christian Bale as opposing drivers, but that idea was quickly put to rest. The legendary Carroll Shelby (Damon) is in the spotlight here as the former racer and design engineer recruited by the Ford Motor Company to build a championship vehicle. In no small measure was it Ford's response to a snub by Italian car maker, Enzo Ferrari, who turned down a merger with the American company in a fit of pique. Had he gone along, the end result in the picture may never have occurred.The movie will call to mind the Steve McQueen race car epic ""Le Mans"" from 1971. With a half century separating the two films, both reliably capture the spirit and flavor of the world's longest endurance test. ""Le Mans"" has more of a documentary type feel than the movie under consideration here, with less of a plot and straightforward story line. Building up to the seminal race in 1966 featured in this film, the story takes an introspective look at the machinations of the Ford Motor Company to control all aspects of engineering a vehicle they hope to defeat the Italians with. Not to mention the politics and marketing aspect of selecting a driver who wouldn't embarrass the company by going public with any developmental problems along the way.For fans and non-fans alike, the racing scenes are thrilling and adrenaline inducing. As driver Ken Mills, Christian Bale exudes nerves of steel and a soaring passion to be the best driver out there, achieving mind boggling speeds that would otherwise strike fear in the hearts of most mortal men. That was comically illustrated in the one scene in which Shelby himself took Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a 'spin' in a car under development. If there's any sense of a let down with the picture, it would have to be the screw job Mills suffered when he agreed to bring in all three of Ford's race cars to the finish line together at Le Mans. Realizing it, Mills bore the slight with dignity, knowing in his heart that he was the best driver out there that day, and nothing could take that away from him."
8,"The first act is like a rushed, convoluted mess; the rest of the film is almost Rush-like!Side-note : Christian Bale definitely deserved to be nominated for best leading role just like De Niro.(8/10)"
8,"Both Bale and Damon are getting old..so am I.
A story I didn't know, told from the perspective of the loser.
David against Goliah, where David are both Ferrari, Miles and Shelby, facing in different ways the Ford ""enemy"".
Miles can't quit his passions and fulfills his faith, a star that after fighting his demons and winning finds his peace no matter he has been mocked and used.
He shines in the end before crashing hard."
8,"The story of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles gets the Hollywood treatment in this nostalgic look at the motor racing scene of the 60's. It also succeeds in harking back to the kind of films Hollywood doesn't make any more.Although this is in many ways a standard three act rise, fall and rise again narrative it's elevated by the excellent central and supporting performances. Damon is on top form as the bullish and ambitious good ol' boy Shelby. Compensating for his own enforced retirement as a driver by building up a successful race car construction company.Bale, as ever, gives a memorable portrayal as the flawed genius Ken Miles. Quick tempered but never nasty, a loveable rogue and family man whose own driving career could clearly have been one of true greatness if not for his inability to compromise or bite his tongue.The two leads rock and roll throughout proceedings, quick to clash but quick to make up again and once on board with the Ford motor company (who are desperate to end Ferrari's dominance of the Le Mans) the film really cooks.The Ford suits are played fairly stereotypically but Josh Lucas is the film's real hissable villain. Playing the smarmy exec role to perfection.Events play out much as you would expect but no less entertaining for it. Even the somewhat cliched speeches and corny English asides (all English people love cups of tea and say Cor Blimey!) Don't detract from the thrills.The racing scenes are noisy and muscular, visceral in the same way as Ron Howard's Rush and put you right in the driving seat. And the final race is the highlight. Here the story even manages a slight twist I didn't see coming and stops the film veering into well worn ground.Top notch stuff, well worth watching."
8,"As a Ferrari fan I was pleasantly on the side of a Ford driver, all because of the soul Christian Bale was able to portrayed as Ken Miles, a sports car racing engineer who's hart was beaten in unison with an engine of a race car. Aside of the fact that he lose several kg for the role, but being a method actor it cling a viewer to the screen. Excitement and rage can be feel in every scene. The passion take us to the circuit and made us push the accelerator. What I miss is the surprise of the plot since I knew the story. The cast is brilliant, and finally in one Americans movie I have the pleasure to see casted Italians brilliants actor for the roles of the Ferrari Team, speaking perfect Italian, as oppose as being disappointed when they cannot.
This year oscar is going to be a difficult choice."
8,"Very good, and the photography from the racing scenes is amazing....but be prepared, probably 5% - 7% of screen time is focused on the footwork of shifting gears, braking or accelerating!"
8,"One of the better movies I have watched out of the last 15hours of recent films I've endured through.
Great acting, natural dialogue that's super relatable.... all up an entertaining film, with racing scenes that any rev head would appreciate."
8,"Great story of Miles and Shelby. How they build a car worth risking. Nicely done movie . Emotions, power, engines, speed and CARS. Well done"
8,"Beautiful film, kind of same old same old but adds its own depth. The performances of the cast is phenomenal, beautiful chemistry and look the film has. Great for the family. I hope Matt Damon gets nominated for an Oscar for his performance too. Christian Bale got a nom for the golden globes so I'm sure he's getting one too. Script is fine, director did great solid 8"
8,"This has become my favorite car movie as there are no distracting sub-plots about love or whatever.
This is a straight forward car movie based on real events and the 2 and a half hours went by as if the movie was going 7000 RPMAmazing acting throughout8.2"
8,Racing champ Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) has to retire due to a medical issue. His racing friend Ken Miles (Christian Bale) is seen as difficult and the IRS has confiscated his garage. Ferrari has been at the top of racing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Ford Motor Company finds its sales going stale and Henry Ford II wants a big idea. Marketing VP Lee Iacocca has the idea to enter the race. They first try to buy Ferrari and Enzo Ferrari insults Henry Ford II. Iacocca recruits Shelby to create a racing car and Shelby recruits Miles to be his driver.This is an old fashion rip roaring good times. Damon and Bale are great. All the actors are great whether it's Tracy Letts being told that he's not Henry Ford or the villainy of Josh Lucas. It's a solid sports underdog story. It's fun like Caitriona Balfe driving crazy. The race is thrilling. It is a perfectly made old fashion movie.
8,"It is the early-1960s and Ford Motor Corporation's fortunes are at a low ebb. In order to boost sales, Ford aims to win the Le Mans 24-hour race, a race dominated by Ferrari over the last few years. To head their team they call in Carroll Shelby, who won Le Mans in 1959. He in turn makes Ken Miles his chief test driver. Together they make a formidable team. However, it is not just Ferrari they have to worry about. Office politics and powerplays within Ford are an even greater threat to the success of the project.I did not have high hopes for this movie before watching it. Despite it being nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, it seemed just like a conventional revhead movie. Turns out, it's better than that, far better than that.Director James Mangold crafts a story that is highly engaging and very fast-paced. You wouldn't know the movie is 2 ½ hours long it is so engrossing: the time speeds by. The racing scenes are amazing, capturing the pace, danger and excitement of motor racing. Throw in good performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale and you have a first-rate movie.Not perfect though. I found the political machinations a bit of a drag and contrived-feeling (even though many of them were true!). While Christian Bale puts in a good performance as Ken Miles, Miles's character is drawn rather stereotypically English, complete with ever-present cups of tea. It seemed a bit trite.Overall: highly entertaining. Don't be put off by the movie's duration: the time whizzes by."
8,"The true story behind the 1966
24 hour Le Mans race serves as a story for the crossing paths between Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and the eccentric British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and how they come together to take down Enzo Ferrari and show ford off as a top contender.James Mangold directs the racing sequences to convey not just the frenetic energy, but also to further the character arcs. Besides the two leads, the supporting cast contributes acting was good.
Mollie miles - caitronia balfe
Leo Beebe - Josh Lucas
Peter miles Noah jupe
Phil Remington - ray mckinnon

Bale is the real focus here and he should be with his amazing believable performance but Damon also does a pretty convincing job as the friend and his knowledge of cars along with Bale's love for them.Now, let's talk about cinematography. The movie gives absolutely stunning experience with it's sound effects and visuals. The movie though was shot under expert guidance, feels more legit.Overall, THIS IS A MUST SEE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
8,"It's a good film, with good performances from Christan bale and matt damon, Racing scenes are amazingly shot with great sound effects."
9,"A really good movie and not a bad action movie I really like it, the whole gang is here. Fast Five (2011) is still to me the best one and my favorite in the franchise and then it would be Furious 6 than The Fast and the Furious I think this would be my fourth favorite film in the franchise. It is an entertaining fun fast paced action film and that really a good one. But it is not perfect I have issues with the film which I will get to it but first I want to write goods about this film.I can't wait till I watch The Fate of the Furious I am getting on Blu-ray next week so yesterday I re-watch this film and I have enjoy it. Furious 7 is the seventh installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the sixth highest-grossing opening of all time. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide – more than the franchise's first five installments combined – making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing film of 2015 and the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, The Fate of the Furious, was released on April 14, 2017.The film's about Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again. The cast includes: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. I like this flick they action is crazier than ever, there's some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces. Kurt Russell is in this and like I have said in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 my review I hated his performance in that movie but in here I loved him he was awesome and a really good guy and likable. He has more to do in this film than he did in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is always terrific and a bad-ass I absolutely love him. Jason Statham is a crazy motherf***** in this I have enjoyed him I always wanted Statham as a bad guy. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz Dom's girlfriend was hot as always I have simply enjoyed her. The rest of the cast was alright.The issues with the film I have is: Why is shaky cam in the beginning of the fights between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham and on the end of the fights between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that really hurts this film. I got a migraine because of the shaking cam.Dwayne Johnson was only in the beginning of the film and for the rest of the film he was departure he appeared only on the end of the film in the final showdown I only wish he would be more in this film and he would have more to do but I still have enjoyed his performance awesome. Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto is useless in this movie she doesn't do nothing her character is just wasted and useless. I don't know why they put her character in this movie. Lucky Michelle Rodriguez fulfill the emptiness in Dom's crew. Car's with flying parachutes also doesn't fit in the film because of the metal weight parachutes can't hold that kind of metal and some unnecessary CGI was used in this film that also hurt the movie. Those are all the issues I have, I can't wait for The Fate of the Furious to see it I heard it is a good film.The rating this film get's is a A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but those issues in my opinion hurt the film. Paul Walker died in November 30 2013 so his two brothers Caleb and Cody Walker replaced him and they help to make this film right so I have enjoy from all three brothers performance. R.I.P. Paul Walker my favorite actor and my all time favorite character of the franchise Brian O'Conner. This film is dedicated to his memory which I love.

9,"As a F&F fan, I've enjoyed every movie in the franchise excluding F3. But, that movie has an important part and effect to the franchise. And now to the film, It was a full action flick alongside with a tear crying tribute to Paul Walker. From the first race of Leticia to the last scene between O'Connor and Toretto, It was one of the best movie in the franchise. The Core part of the story tells us about good ol' fashioned revenge combined with Speed of NOS and muscle. Deckard Shaw seeks out his kind of style revenge which pulls Toretto and his family into Shaw's world.And so, he combine forces Mr. Nobody to complete a mission for him and in return gets Deckerd Shaw. What happens afterwards, is your's to see. The performance of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is fantastic. From the Screenplay to their actions, their brother 2 brother relationship was amazing. Michelle Rodriguez played her principal cast perfectly. She had done homework in her fighting and she looks gorgeous as always. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson played their respective roles well and their chemistry for humor doesn't cease to amaze at most of the times. Rock and Tony Jaa and other's also played their part to their maximum. But Elsa Pataky wasn't given that much to her role. She was a like a cameo appearance but it wasn't that much necessary to include in the whole movie. The graphics and stunts was nearly mind blowing except that the CGI work done for Paul is notable at some times. But, it wasn't that much drawback for the movie as he played his part well and his brother's completed the work he is done. The franchise might have losen a big cast, but it manages to keep the film to the edge of the seat climax. The tribute given by Vin Diesel for him is absolutely superb. It was very touching when he said,""It's never Goodbye"" and when they separate in cross roads, it was really amazing to give such an tribute to Paul Walker.Overall, as the franchise keeps promising its Action and Adrenaline, it manages to keep it together even though they lost Paul Walker. A must see for everyone. Try it in a cinema and your money's value will be nicely spent for a good entertainment."
9,"Perhaps Furious 7 wouldn't have that Box Office success and Popularity if the sudden death of one the main protagonists, Paul Walker AKA Brian O'Conner wouldn't have gotten in the way.But this is how it is. The heartbreaking death of Paul in that terrible car crash has made this movie so special to the heart of the long standing fans. The script can be so cliché and full of inconsistencies, this movie is the last film of Paul Walker and will always be.But what makes me to give that high note is the ending scene and the awesome tribute the rest of the fast and furious 'familia' made to Paul. They could have gotten his character to die like we have seen so many times in the past. Instead the scriptwriters rewrote the script to make a celebration of life and family.In fact, This entire saga is more about family than cars. Cars and race are just the theme and the objects attracting our attention. But the most important part of that story is the strong relationship between the characters and their interprets who are as linked in real life as they are in the movie. Each time one of their own dies they face it together as the actors are actually doing it with the loss of Paul the only REAL loss of this community. And this is what is making this beautiful."
9,"Dominic Toretta (Vin Diesel) gets his Team together to take out Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is on a revenge kick blaming Dominic for his brother lying in a coma. But first, the Team must find and protect Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) a master Hacker/Programmer, who created God's Eye, a program that can locate anyone anywhere on the planet. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), the head of Black Ops, says Ramsey must be found if Dominic wants his help with Shaw.This should be watched for the stunts and CGI as both are terrific. We will see cars race down a mountain side with many trees in the way; and also see a car jump from one hi-rise building in Dubai into another hi-rise building. These stunts or CGI (who can tell anymore) will take your breath away.The pacing is very good for these stunts and CGI, but when Dominic and Shaw did hand-to-hand combat it went on forever. The scene would cut away often to the Team in cars trying to avoid the helicopter intent on taking them out with missiles, then revert back to these two who were still at it. Did I mention ""still"" at it. Yes, way too long. The real winners in here are, of course, the stunts and CGI because they were terrific. And mention must be made for the photography, editing and cinematography as they were spot on.Notables: Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Michelle Rodrigues as Letty, Lucacris as Tej, Jordana Brewster as Mia, Tyrese Gibson as Roman, Lucas Black as Sean, and Ronda Rousey the Champion MMA fighter. You will see Rhonda as Kara in a white dress fighting Letty. (a cat fight?) And certainly Paul Walker (Brian) who died in a car crash (he was not driving) during the filming of Furious 7. The song ""See you Again"" that played in the movie was a tribute to Paul Walker.All in all this was terrific and the action never dragged or went on for too long as scene changes helped that out a lot. This will be hard to top and there is talk of Furious 8. Ready for it? (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Bikini and thong backsides. Language: Small stuff and not much of it."
9,"Furious Seven (aka The Fast and Furious 7), directed by James Wan, was a roller coaster of emotions for many viewers. Continuing from the storyline after the events of The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast & Furious 6, Dominic Toretto investigates the murder of his long-time friend Han. Han was a previous member of the Fast & Furious crew in the past few installments. Following the investigation, Toretto discovers that Deckard Shaw is targeting Dom and his crew. Deckard, played by Jason Statham, is seeking revenge for the condition of his brother Owen Shaw. Once again, Dom gathers the remaining members of his team (Brian, Tej, Roman and Letty) to take down Deckard. Throughout the movie, Deckard seems to always be a few steps ahead of Dom, interrupting the crew's plans to capture Deckard. Toretto encounters Mr. Nobody, a government official, and discusses with him the possibility of catching Deckard. Mr. Nobody is in a struggle with Somalian terrorist Jakonde to obtain the powerful computer program ""God's Eye"". Mr. Nobody asks for the help of Toretto and his team to steal the computer program, and in return, he will allow Toretto to use the program to locate Deckard. With action packed car chases and thrilling flight moments, it's a race of time for Dom and Deckard to have their final face-off and prove which of the two would come out of their fight alive. The Fast & Furious franchise was originally known for its modified cars, street racing, and crime induced thrills from its first movie. Justin Lin, director for the Fast & Furious installments 2-6, focused on modern cars that take ""fast"" to the next level. James Wan, the new director for the 7th installment of the franchise, proceeded to take the series into a more action driven direction. A few notable death-defying moments in Furious 7 were creatively written to add more thrill to the film. In the beginning of the movie, Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson, jumped out of a police building seconds before Deckard threw a grenade at him. When Toretto and his team needed to ambush Jakande undetected, they decided to skydive in their cars to Jakande's location. The most memorable scene for me was when Toretto and Brian drove off Abu Dhabi's Etihad Towers in a Lykan Hypersport car. The cinematography of the beautiful sunset and glossy towers while the car was in slow motion midair was breathtaking. It really showed the extravagance and majesty of Abu Dhabi. With the movie's thrilling car flying scenes and intense fight or flight moments, James Wan successfully keeps us at the edge of our seats. The movie ties up all the previous installments to lead the plot into one intertwined direction. When looking at the time line of the story in each installment, the movies follow the plot starting from the 1st movie, to the 2nd, 4th, and then the 5th. Afterwards, the storyline moves on to the 3rd & 6th simultaneously. From the storyline of its 3rd and 6th installments, Furious 7 connects the time line and adds elements found from the previous movies. A scene in Furious 7 involved Toretto's team in a high speed chase that allowed one of the cars to slip right under a moving truck, which is an element found in the first movie. In Furious 7, another scene depicts one of the Toretto members driving backwards to rescue the programmer of the God's Eye. A similar circumstance is found in the 2nd installment when Brian drove his car backwards to rescue Roman. It was very clever of Wan to embed elements like these from prior movies. The decision to include these creative elements conveys the connection that bridges the franchise under Justin Lin to this ""new"" and developing franchise under James Wan. In every Fast & Furious movie, Toretto emphasizes his focus on family. Family is the number one thing he protects and risks his entire life for. However, in Furious 7, it is presented in a different but more elaborate way. In the 7th installment, the theme of family transforms into closure for Han, Letty, and Brian. Han's death was a terrible loss for the Toretto family, and Toretto's answer for his death was revenge. After discovering that Han's death wasn't an accident, Toretto set out to settle the score with Deckard Shaw who murdered him. Letty's closure dealt with getting her memory back, as she was diagnosed with amnesia from her incident in the previous movie. Toretto needed his number one support system during the movie and was greatly concerned over Letty's stability. He struggled with Letty's condition because he couldn't let go of their history. When Letty got her memory back, Toretto and Letty got married, which solidified Toretto's family values. Brian was the biggest loss to not only the Toretto family, but to the Fast & Furious franchise as well. The writers and director were able to adapt to the sudden and unfortunate loss of a main cast member of the movie. Paul Walker, who played Brian O' Conner, was unfortunately involved in a fatal car accident shortly before the completion of the film. The director did a wonderful job of casting Walker's brothers Caleb and Cody to complete Brian's plot line. As a tribute to Walker, the movie ended with Toretto parting ways with Brian. The ending suggests that Brian settles down with his family. Many people may not agree with the transition on the focus of the movie. Moving from high-speed car races loaded with modifications and cleverly planned heists to high action packed scenes and impossible death-defying dangerous escapes, the Fast & Furious series is evolving into a typical genre we can find in many action movies today."
9,"Fast and Furious is a series of action films by James Wan; it is one of the best American franchises which centers on heists, crimes and illegal street racing. The film was established in 2001 with the title The Fast and The Furious, and the last film of the series called Furious Seven just came out at the beginning of this year. This movie is definitely one my favorites so far this year because of it's fascinating scenes, interesting story and great characters.The movie Furious Seven took place after Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Connor and the rest of their team defeated and hospitalized Owen Shaw. Dominic and his team decided to come back to the United States to live a normal life with their family. Shortly after the death of Owen Shaw, his older brother, Deckard Shaw was seeking revenge against Toretto and his team. After Deckard Shaw killed Dominic's close friend Han, one of the main characters in the previous series, Toretto and O'Connor gathered the team and were on the hunt for Deckard Shaw. The team also got helped from a secretive government agency after they had freed a kidnapped computer hacker, who had created a device that can help them capture Shaw. Deckard Shaw was the antagonist in the movie, and Dominic Toretto was the leader of their group. All the orders were given from Toretto. He and his team now put it all in the line for one last ride. They decided to return to their hometown, Los Angeles, to fight Deckard Shaw. After all, justice always win. Shaw was taken into custody and locked away in a high-security prison, and Toretto, Brian and the team could finally be off retired with their family.James Wan, director of the movie did a really good job on connecting all the circumstances which made the film more interesting. All the actors in the movie had different roles that they portrayed. For example Dominic Toretto was the leader of the team, so he always has a stern deep voice and a tough exterior that a leader would. The film took place in many locations like Los Angeles, Tokyo, and India. The outfits that they characters had worn were not flashy. It was standard clothing that an average person would wear. The effects in the movie were very precise. Nothing seemed to have many computerized effects to it. The angels were shot in all directions where the audience was able to see all of the action that was taking place. Also the angles were all being shot to where the cars are being shown in all directions. The sound effects in the movie were accurate, the sound of the cars were exactly how you would hear it if it passed by on the street. Using real authentic sounds for their vehicles and weapons made the movie come to life.The movie ended with a wonderful tribute to Paul Walker, played as Brian who died in a car accident in the middle of filming the movie. This is one of the emotional moments that got so many tears from the fans of both the series and the actor."
9,"I thought that it was actually a really good movie. I don't mean that I don't like the other movies, I just think that it's hard to get this movies as good as the first 6. I thought the editing crew did a really good job at taking scenes from the other movies to make it seem like Paul was there the whole time. The part of Ramsey was really good, she worked well with the other actors especially Vin. The song choices were really good and they went along with the movie really well. The plot twits were really good for me because I love movies that you can't tell what's going to happen. Such as Dom being married to Letty the whole time. I don't know if anybody was expecting that but I wasn't at all. In conclusion I like the movie and it would have to be one of my favorites out of the seven."
9,"This is one of those movies where the French decided on an English name but for some inexplicable reason the original English name was not good enough for them. So in France it is called Fast & Furious 7 but I believe it is called Furious Seven in the US. Typical French way of doing things I am afraid.This movie is probably not for everyone. It is very typical for the latest Fast & Furious movies though. The movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did I mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. For me it was just what I expected and just what I wanted from this particular movie as well. If you are into fast cars, lots of action and explosive special effects and a bit of male macho talk then this movie will please you just fine.The gang is back. I have to confess that I like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson even though they are rather far from Shakespeare material as far as acting goes. For this kind of movie they are perfect though. Unfortunately Dwayne Johnson was absent for a good chunk of the movie. When he came back from his brief presence in the beginning of the movie he did so with a vengeance though. I was actually expecting to dislike ""Mr Nobody"" but I have to say that I quite liked him.Despite the fact that this is a macho action movie there is at least a small kernel of story in there. It is a classical revenge story but it is embellished with enough material to make it fairly decent. Well, decent within the confines of this kind of movie of course. Seen from a reasonable point of view the entire movie is of course totally ludicrous. The stunts are really cool but if you sober up from the adrenaline feast you rather quickly find a lot of the stunts pretty far out. Like jumping between buildings in fancy cars and such like. Even if we skip the most ridiculous scenes there are plenty more to nit-pick about. Like the fact that those old, but cool, American cars that Torretto drives would not have a chance in hell against his more modern adversaries unless possibly if the road was entirely straight. But then, these ridiculous things are what the fast and furious series is all about is it not? Well, after about two hours of ludicrous, but very entertaining, actions stunts there is a happy ending and when the credits roll this viewer is definitely a happy customer."
9,"I will admit that I'm not a massive fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but Fast & Furious 7 was a real treat in the early days of 2015. It was an intensely thrilling action packed joy ride and I had a really great time watching Furious 7.Firstly, I will admit that there were some moments in the film that I felt were a little out of place sort of. Although those moments didn't exactly drop the film in a way, they were just a little unrealistic. I also thought that they could've used Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson a lot more in this movie since he only had about 10 minutes of screen time, if not less.That all aside, this was classic explosive Fast & Furious car action. Vin Diesel was amazing in this movie; this time around he plays a more dramatic role since this movie pays a tribute to recently deceased star of the franchise, Paul Walker, making this movie more of a drama than a thriller action film, which I think does it's job really really well at that. I'll admit, I was tearing up at that point.Jason Statham also kills it in this movie. I've admired his acting skills, but I think this is the movie that I am going to remember him from the most out of every movie he's done. He is a good actor, but as the main villain in this movie, Deckard Shaw, I thought he delivered the most.Overall, I had a blast with Fast & Furious 7, it was exciting and emotional, it made us all laugh and cry. I have listened to that song by Charlie Puth and Wiz Khalifa ""See You Again"" so many times, I love that song, it's a perfect way to carry the film's emotional tribute to Paul Walker and to give him the perfect send-off.For Paul 9.9/10"
9,"I rate this movie 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. I think the word would be 'The Awesomest' part of the Fast & Furious series. Great work by all the stars. No doubt, this movie is a tribute to my favorite Paul Walker. Toretto asked him for one last ride and see it became his last. The action part in the movie, specially the stunts were just out of the world. I don't have words to explain how fast my heart was beating when i saw Paul jumping over the cliff to grab the car. I was just damned to see it.. and I was like 'how the hell did he do this'. Hats off to you Brian. One thing which made us Indians proud too was the casting of Ali Fazal in such a big movie. He was also very good in his role. All the stars did their parts very well. And I just love this dialog... I don't have friends, I got family. What an attitude u have Dom... just be like it always. At last, we do know that we will not be seeing Paul in the next sequel... it's kind of disappointing but he will always be in our hearts. Hell Yeah..!!!!"
9,"Furious 7: Without a doubt, this is the biggest fast and furious movie to date. Everything is bigger. The action scenes are bigger, the car scenes are even faster, and of course, ""The Rock"" is bigger. Furious 7 was already highly anticipated, and then tragedy struck, Paul Walker was killed in a car crash when filming. He will always be sorely missed and no one can ever take his place. Even though some of the dialogue and action might be a little cheesy, with great action and car sequences, Paul Walker got the send off he deserved in the series he dedicated his life to.What I mean by cheesy dialogue is primarily applied to ""The Rock's"" lines in the movie. He still has a supporting role but it is not nearly as big as his role in the previous two films. To put it simply, his entire dialogue is a series of one-liners to show how big of a badass he is if for some reason you can't already tell. It is amusing still, but it gets slightly irritating after a while. Once he takes out a few helicopters single handedly, you forget those lines and just laugh and love the enormous action taking place. The trailer also clearly shows Jason Stathom who plays Deckard Shaw in this installment as the main villain, but he really is only sprinkled throughout the plot. He never really gets the same screen time Luke Evans, who played Owen Shaw, in the previous installment got. Nevertheless, in the screen time he gets, he acts like the ultimate badass that he is and we can't ask for anything more.The action and car scenes speak for themselves. In some of the tallest buildings in the world, we see Vin Diesel and Paul Walker practically fly a car straight through three of them and you can't ask for more than that. Sure, it might be outlandishly crazy but everyone should know walking into this movie that it is a hardcore action-car film, not an art film. The fight scenes are also pretty well done. Seeing Vin Diesel and Jason Statham going in a slow-mo glorifying fight to the end shot is incredibly funny and widely entertaining at the same time. The acting is what we have come to expect from each cast member. They all own their roles. They are their characters at this point. Sure, some may not consider it ""real"" acting but the actors did their part for the movie and you can't ask for anything more. Also, as I said earlier, Paul Walker's send off really was tremendous and many of the audience members might actually find themselves tearing up towards the end as we all listen to the song ""See You Again,"" which I think might be nominated for an Oscar for best original song. If you just want pure-thrilling entertainment with some laughs thrown in here and there, you should definitely see Furious 7. Since this is a movie where it is a hundred times better on the big screen, I recommend you see Furious 7 in theaters. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
9,"First of all I wanted to say that this is one of my all time favorite film. Though, it was pretty sad but I did enjoy it anyway. I love the connection they have between the cast in the film they are original and as if they are a real family. I've been such a big fan of the fast and furious series since the beginning and I'm glad that this is not the final one.I absolutely love every part of this film and that it contains such an amazing actors, incredible action scene and cool effects that capture my attention. I also like the comedy side of Tyrese and Ludicrous it was very hilarious. And obviously this movie is a tribute to one of my absolute favorite character Paul Walker as I said before that it was pretty sad because this is the last Paul Walker film.I wanted to recommend this movie to my of you who love the cast of this film, action movies and a fan of F and F series."
9,"I don't review many titles on IMDb. They need to touch me somehow before I bother.Paul Walker. I remember his interview when the first F and F one was released and he wasn't much of a Hollywood namesake before then. I loved him instantaneously in that interview. There was something that reminded me of my brother in the eyes. Oddly both he and my brother were twisted in fate somehow, for they both were loving individuals who died doing something they loved, at similar ages, leaving loved ones behind. Paul succeeded my brother by 6 years so the blow was difficult when he passed, and was more raw when he died in a similar circumstance. I followed Vin from his early days on FB, long before pages were creates and friends with stars were made. He always touched me with his love of life, and his respect for his colleagues, starring roles or not, and believed his deep love for Paul.I avoided this movie like the plague. I knew it would burn deep, and it dd, with a rawness I didn't want to feel. It was a fitting farewell, reuniting many of the original cast. The final scene was a moving one, for although it was ambiguous to the storyline, we all knew that Paul was not to return for another, and the words spoken by Vin Diesel were so deeply moving you knew they were not only for the Brian, they were for Paul too. Tears, accolades, and a touching farewell to Paul Walker. May you linger over a long lunch with my brother up there, and share your love of all things fast and furious, for you were both too fast and furious for this world."
9,"The speedy band of outlaws have surfaced unscathed from impossible missions around the world with varying motives behind each outing. While financial security and independence drove them through streets of Brazil in 'Fast Five', the desperate need to secure amnesty sent them flying across the highways of Spain in '6'. But this time, things get more personal. For the villain, it's all about retribution and for Dominic Torreto, it's about keeping the familia safe together. For a franchise that set a disclaimer long ago to leave brains behind in lieu of horsepowers, it does pretty well to align the stories through 7 movies and yet keep the team intact for the most part. Dom's position as the alpha hasn't been more at the forefront than it is now. ""This time it ain't just about being fast"". 'Furious 7' promises bigger, better action as muscles of both cars and humans collide to cause destruction. James Wan ('Saw', 'Insidious', 'Conjuring') is serious about taking crazy to a whole new level when it comes to the action. After looking at the plight of his incarcerated brother Owen, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) swears to avenge him by taking down Dominic and his team. During an information extracting break-in at Hobbs' (Dwayne Johnson) office, Shaw confronts the DSS agent and sends him flying out of the window straight to a hospital bed. Then, Shaw calls Dom from Japan, just as he has killed Han and threatens to take him down next. An explosion rips apart the Torreto house, with Mia (Jordana Brewster), Brian (Paul Walker) and Dom narrowly escaping. After learning from Hobbs about how deadly Shaw can be, Dom retrieves Han's body from Japan to perform his funeral back home. A suspicious looking car draws Dom's attention who chases it, leading to a head on collision between the two. At this point, Frank Petty and his covert ops team arrive and assure Dom that it would be easy for them to hand over Shaw to him anytime. However, Dom would have to perform a mission impossible for the US Government. It involved extracting a hacker named Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) from the convoy of Mercenary Jackande by air-dropping onto a restricted highway in the Caucasus mountains. This bit of action is the highlight of the film. Ramsey created a computer program called God's eye that can use every digital device to track people anywhere. The flash drive containing the program has been sold to a Jordanian Prince in Abu Dhabi who has it hidden in his Lykan hypersport supercar. What follows is something you should only watch on the big screen with popcorn. With God's eye then falling into Jackande's hands again, the finale takes us back to home turf with some exemplary stunts, some raw action between Shaw and Dom and God's eye chasing Ramsey in cars that zip through LA's streets. All this mayhem however, ends with the film's most important subject that must've been the hardest for the film-makers to deal with. The manner in which they brought closure to Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner is heart- warming, elegant and fitting as it says a passive yet emphatic goodbye to one of the familia. Wiz Khalifa's tribute is already a chartbuster and the sequence with montages from previous films honors the legacy of Walker.Vin Diesel may not have the acting skills that would enable him to be anyone but Dominic Torreto effectively. But with so many successful films in one franchise, he may not need the alternatives. He is truly the alpha of this series and here, he proves it yet again in the fight sequences with Statham. As bad-ass as he can be, he's still very affable when he stands by his values for his family. In the last ride sequence, it shows that he genuinely lost a brother. Dwayne Johnson has a brief role but when he's on, he is on! Michelle Rodriguez really takes the alpha role seriously too especially with her fight sequences in the Etihad towers. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous are hilarious together while Jason Statham is well, Jason Statham. But the finest performance has been delivered by WETA digital (yet again), in the motion capture and re-imaging of Paul Walker's prior appearances onto his brothers who acted as body-doubles. The transition is so remarkable that it's virtually impossible to point out the digitalized scenes containing WETA's Walker. Technology has advanced way beyond the CGI in the car chases and action sequences that make up the rest of the film and 'Furious 7' has one of its finest accomplishments. The entire sequence in Azerbaijan is thrilling and gutsy. From Dom's escape down the hill to the on-the-edge bus scene that has us gazing at the screen in disbelief. Abu Dhabi's flying car scene is ridiculous but nevertheless, exciting because they push those limits too. Finally, the stunts and explosions in LA are no doubt, innovative. The film-makers claim to have used real stunts in most of the action sequences and minimized the role of CGI which is commendable, given the grand scale of destruction and mayhem. In spite of all its obvious flaws in story-telling and character development, 'Furious 7' is an awesome entertainer. By now, one should expect the limits of practicality to be tested in this series and simply embrace the thrilling ride. As Dom's beloved '69 Dodge Charger roars against Shaw's refined yet ferocious Aston Martin DB9, the sounds of engine revs and tyre burns block out all the shortfalls as adrenaline starts pumping again for mayhem. Not surprisingly, this series has us invested in the familia. The freedom they value, the honor they stand for and the thrill they seek on the streets. The lump in the throat effect that the last ride has, is a testament to that very notion. 8.59 on a scale of 1-10."
9,"I just saw Furious 7 and as a fan of previous films of this series I had a lot of expectations.This movie really was better than my expectations.This movie is better than all previous films. . Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw performed really good.Paul Walker in his last movie is looking good but the man who steals the show is Vin Diesel.All that car scenes from building to building,sexy girls,hot cars,steamy locations make this movie even better.So I suggest u that this is a must watch for everyone.If you are a fan of cars,action and a little comedy this one is really for you.This movie is a pure action flick for people of every age.Spend some money and go to cinema Ã°Å¸Å½Â¦.Watch this movie Ã°Å¸Å½Â¬ and you will see that your money Ã°Å¸'Âµ is not wasted.Believe me."
9,"For two years ago, I walked happy out of the cinema full of energy to get in a car and just road rage through the city - even though I didn't have the license. This time, I drove home, with the license, full of emotional memories. Paul Walker (and not forgetting his driver who deserve some love too) died two years ago, during the filming of the seventh film. This caused some delay on the movie, and the some scenes, including the ending had too rewritten again. This ending is one of the best endings in a movie I have ever seen, and for me it marked a perfect conclusion to the franchise. I hope. It will make me furious (no pun intended) if they decide to make an eight movie. There was simply nothing that I noticed during the film that can possibly trigger a new movie in the franchise.But enough nagging, what about the actual movie? The plot this time around is as following. The brother of Owen Shaw, Deckard Shaw, wants revenge for what Dom and his team/family did to Deckard's brother. Dominic and his family are thereby hunted and they have to find a way to stop him. They end up teaming up with what I recall was the government, leaded by Mr. Nobody. He and his team are willing to help Dominic find his hunter, and make a stop to him, if they can retrieve a girl named Ramsey and her program, ""The God Eye"", which can connect to every technical advice in the world to find wanted persons. When they get this program, they can use it to track down Shaw. This is the main storyline of the movie, however there are some side story, such as Letty struggling to regain her memory, and Brain who tries to begin a normal life as a father and a family man.As many already know, Paul Walkers brothers were hired to finish the last few scenes as body-doubles for Paul, with the help of CGI. The use of CGI to make Paul look like himself is remarkably good. I looked up online and found out that scenes where I thought he was acting on stage, was entirely done by his brothers and CGI. While I'm talking about CGI, the special effects are also a blast to watch. The movie does also a good job by giving a lot of SFX when the highlights are being shown, and stops when enough is enough. There are a lot of fast cuts in this movie, which pushes the speed of the scenes and makes the movie a lot more intense.The acting is as always great. Tyrese Gibson, hilarious as always, do always has his moments to shine when he is on the screen. Vin Diesel is a great leading roll with Paul Walker on his side. Scenes with these two together are great, and we can truly see how close these two friends were in real life when they have scenes for themselves. The rest of the cast are great as well. Jason Statham is a cold, poker- faced villain who fits perfectly to the roll. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is not so much shown this time around. But when he is on the screen, he is the most bad ass character of them all. The only actress that I find a little bit weird is Nathalie Emmanuel. She is OK, but does sometimes feels like she is bored or something. She is also the most annoying character in the movie.All in all, I think this is a great film. I had a blast watching it. Personally I hope they will end franchise with this movie. They couldn't make a better ending to the franchise then this. It has been a fun ride, but it is time to park the car.9/10"
9,"I'm not gonna lie! I love this franchise. Aside from the third movie, I enjoy each one of them. You can't ask for much more when it comes to action movies. This series has always been a box office attraction, but the real story is Paul Walker's tragic death. I remember being really saddened when I read about his untimely death. He had come such a long way as an actor. He was getting better and better, and the sky was the limit for him. I was so pumped to go see this movie! My expectations were pretty high. I'm happy to say that it not only met my expectations, but transcended them as well. If you're looking for a great story, look elsewhere! This movie isn't about that. It has plenty of emotion and a decent enough story for this type of thing, but this puppy is all about action. I thought after the 6th one, they had nowhere to go after it. What else could they possibly do, how could they top themselves? Well, they did it! In convincing fashion. This is like 5 action movies in one. If you think you've seen it all, you haven't! There are action scenes in this movie that I didn't think were possible. They are incredibly unbelievable and WAY OTT, but undeniably exhilarating. I thought some of the situations they got out of in the 5th and 6th movies were ridiculous, this one takes the cake. It rarely gives you a chance to breathe! Just when you settle down, along comes another action scene to amaze you. As an adrenaline junkie, I loved every second of it. I'm not gonna list all of them, but I'll mention a couple. One involves Brian and a huge truck at the edge of a cliff. It's completely implausible, but I was on the edge of my seat! Another involves Dom and his destruction of vehicles. I won't spoil them, but they are memorable. The acting is solid! Vin won't ever be known as a great actor, but he has a lot of presence and charisma. He is always reliable in these movies. Paul Walker is really good as Brian. I was really happy with the tribute they did for him at the end. It was very moving and touching. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) Is a hoot as Hobbs. It sucks that he didn't have as much screen time, but his crazy antics were a blast to watch! Great lines as well. Michelle Rodriguez isn't the Letty we know. She's damaged and vulnerable. I'm so used to seeing Michelle playing bad-ass roles, so it was cool. Jason Statham is a fun villain. You know what to expect when it comes from him. Kicking ass and taking names. Jordana Brewster doesn't have much to do, but she was good. As a huge Kurt Russell fan, it was a treat to see him again. He was hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson do well in their roles. Special mention to Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey! Tony Jaa actually gets a chance to showcase his phenomenal skill set. His fight scenes with Paul Walker will get your adrenaline going. I hate sitting in a theater for over two hours, but it was completely worth it. You don't have time to get fidgety in your seat. There is so much going on that you'll be glued to the screen. I'm not sure if they should do an 8th movie or not. If they make one, I'll be more than happy to see it! But I think this was the perfect ending to this franchise. Whether it's the end or not, thank you for some great entertainment. 9/10"
9,"If you didn't know actor Paul Walker perished in a fiery car crash back on November 30, 2013, you'd never know it by watching ""Furious 7, the latest installment in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. ""Saw"" director James Wan and ""Wanted"" scenarist Chris Morgan had about half of this mammoth $250 million movie made when tragedy struck and claimed Walker's life. Altogether, ""Furious 7"" emerges not only as a cinematic eulogy to Walker's ephemeral career but also as a white-knuckled, super-charged, adrenaline-laced actioneer. Initially, ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) crossed the finish line as an above-average, illegal road-racing epic about an undercover cop that bolstered actor Vin Diesel's box office clout while it forged Paul Walker's career. Walker carried on with Tyrese Gibson after a disaffected Diesel bowed out of 2003's sequel ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" but the chrome-domed Diesel gave his blessing to the chronologically out-of-sequence ""Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006) with a post end credits cameo. Some consider ""Tokyo Drift"" the nadir of the franchise, but I contend that ""Tokyo Drift"" surpassed its skid mark of a predecessor. The three sequels that ensued fueled the franchise with even more vitality. Not even Walker's demise could put the brakes on ""Furious 7."" Mind you, ""Furious 7"" doesn't qualify as an artistic magnum opus. Nevertheless, aside from either the James Bond blockbusters or the Harry Potter series, can you name a contemporary franchise with as many sequels as ""The Fast and the Furious?"" Whether we see an eighth entry, ""Furious 7"" has knocked the bottom out of the franchise. Wan and Morgan have concocted some preposterous high-octane stunts that defy gravity as well as logic but look extraordinary. Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou, and Asian ""Ong Bak"" martial arts sensation Tony Jarr augment the original cast and invigorate these improbable shenanigans. If ""Furious 7"" marks your initiation to the franchise, you're going to have a blast catching up with the rest of us. ""Furious 7"" ranks as the top of the heap in a franchise that has never throttled back. In ""Fast & Furious 6,"" Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson of ""Hercules"") persuaded Dominic Torretto (Vin Diesel of ""xXx"") to assemble his crew, including former LAPD cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker of ""Running Scared""), Roman (Tyrese Gibson of ""Transformers""), Teg (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), and Han (Sung Kang of ""Ninja Assassin"") to help him nab a band of global mercenaries. The criminal mastermind of the group, ex-British Special Forces commander Owen Shaw (Luke Evans of ""Dracula Untold""), likes to think big. As just compensation, Hobbs promised pardons to Dom and his gang. Meantime, Hobbs showed Dom a photo of our protagonist's long lost squeeze, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez of ""Girlfight""), and this strengthened Dom's resolve to seize Shaw. When ""Furious 7"" unfolds, we meet Shaw's indestructible brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham of ""The Transporter""), who has just murdered Han in Hong Kong. Later, he wipes out an entire team of guards at the British hospital where his crippled brother clings to life. The indefatigable Deckard vows to make anybody who had anything to do with his brother's calamity pay with their lives. After he ices Han, Deckard heads to Los Angeles and hacks into Hobbs' computer. Hobbs catches him in the act, and they tangle, swap sledgehammer blows, and virtually demolish DSS headquarters. Hobbs narrowly escapes death when Deckard detonates a grenade. Not long after his larger-than-life brawl with Hobbs, Deckard has a package delivered to Dom's house. The explosion doesn't kill anybody, but little is left of the iconic house where Brian and Dom's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) met and washed dishes together. At this point, Brian's wife Mia has given birth to a toddler, Jack, but she hasn't told her husband that she is pregnant with another child. Brian is struggling to get the hang of taking Jack to day care in a mini-van, and Brian's first scene at day care is hilarious. Although he is confined to the hospital, Hobbs summons Dom to his bedside and tells him ""like a brother"" to take Deckard down. Deckard stalks our heroes at Han's funeral, and Dom and he crash cars head-on into each other. Before they can do additional damage, an army of soldiers supervised by the natty Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell of ""Escape from New York"") intervenes and saves Dom from certain death. Mr. Nobody and Dom share a mutual friend, Hobbs, and Nobody is prepared to help Dom locate the elusive Deckard. Nobody shows Dom a sophisticated gadget that can track anybody anywhere. Basically, it's reminiscent of CBS-TV's ""Person of Interest"" computer. Mr. Nobody refers to it as ""God's Eye,"" and he assures Dom that the government would have caught Osama bin Laden overnight had they had such a doodad. The problem is that the individual with the key component to ""God's Eye"" is a mysterious somebody named Ramsey. Ramsey, it turns out, is being held captive by notorious terrorist Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou of ""Amistad"") who wants the same gizmo. Several outlandish action set-pieces later, our heroes get what they want, but neither Deckard nor Jakande make it a picnic.Director James Wan rarely lets the episodic action loiter, and he integrates the late Paul Walker seamlessly into several exciting escapades. One incredible cliffhanger scene occurs on a switchback highway atop a craggy mountain where our daredevil heroes struggle to extract Ramsey from a fortified bus armed with six Vulcan mini-cannons. At one point, Walker's Brian O'Connor finds himself dangling from the wrecked bus as it teeters precariously over the edge of a precipice. Brian must scramble across the top of the bus before it plunges into the canyon below. Wan orchestrates several suspenseful, careening car chases. Another staggering stunt has our heroes propelling a priceless sports car through two luxury, skyscrapers in exotic Abu Dhabi to recover Ramsey's device. ""Furious 7"" rivals a James Bond extravaganza with its breathtaking, melodramatic mayhem!"
9,"This film tells the story of a team of daredevil drivers who ate recruited by the secret service to rescue a kidnapped hacker who has invented a powerful surveillance software.With the series being the who's who of conventional action superstars, ""Fast And Furious 7"" finally corrected the conspicuous absence of Jason Statham. He certainly doesn't disappoint, as every star deliver awesome action scenes. This film is different from the others because it's really good. It's not ridiculous and brainless like ""The Expendables"" series; and it's not attention deficit like the Bourne series. This combines action, brains and emotions, which is a perfect blend for blockbuster success. The action scenes are simply awesome. The scene of a car flying between buildings is superb, but by no means the best. There are so many other astounding scenes that got me holding my breath, literally. For example, Paul Walker trying to escape from a bus is a scene that made me stop breathing because it's so intense. The film is so packed with action, but it doesn't feel fragmented or attention deficit. That is what makes it stand above other action films.""Fast And Furious 7"" constantly surprises me with jaw dropping action. Just when I thought I have seen everything, and nothing can surprise me anymore, the surprises keep on coming. I'm truly amazed by the film. I guess no one thought James Wan could make such an awe inspiring film, after establishing himself as a great horror director."
9,"FURIOUS 7 starts its engine quietly, depicting cast members now back to their normal lives in the United States. But the wheel doesn't stop there (Statham), and with the arrival of a new enemy, the engine immediately roars anew and gears the movie toward an unprecedented high-velocity escapade, giving way to the most explosive, and probably, the most heart-wrenching chapter of the series, yet. YET, yes, because the saga doesn't show any sign of retirement, and with the new heights reached in Furious 7, the signage is quiet clear: the franchise is nowhere near its final destination.There's a haunting poignancy in how the movie reiterates ""family"" and sticking together, while keeping the blazing momentum of the speed and action unperturbed, if not ever progressing. Centripetal to this theme, is Paul Walker's character's retirement, fueling the film's emotional core with piercing capacity . The level of action are thrust into all new-heights, and visual drama are brought into breathtaking levels. Whether action and emotions are immiscible or not, that theory is totally dismissed here, as both blends well to bring the attempt into a glorious result.While the narrative is far from perfect, there are lots of reasons to shrug off such shortcoming. The movie vaunts a solid assemblage of action stars led by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham. Jason Statham, plays as the main antagonist here, and he makes a decent job, so does Vin Diesel as the leader of the crew. There is no shortage of visual extravagance, as every high-octane action stunt is delivered with breathtaking CGI-trickery, magnifying the thrill into several seismic folds. At such instances, the visual artistry overshadows the real intention of the moment, and when it does, the narrative falls with no more than rudimentary appeal. But then again, with the level of adrenaline employed to fuel up the death-defying action sequences that looms up every now and then, it will be totally forgivable to lose thought of the said flaw, and just enjoy the ride.Regardless of its faults , FURIOUS 7 is a ride worth taking over and over again, not only because of the level of action it presents, but more strikingly, of how its core is imbued with resonating message of family and brotherhood. Evident to this, is how it pays tribute to Brian (Walker), dotting the movie with flashbacks of him, to further build up his character. And towards the end, as the momentum further spikes, the film places Brian on spotlight, bringing the movie into a highly sentimental send off and a heart-rupturing finish. This film deserves 9/10."
9,"I saw Furious 7 at a SXSW screening. The sudden death of Paul Walker shocked his fans and the people who were setting hopes for another F&F movie. Well, James Wan and his crew managed to pull it together using CGI and stunt doubles. I have to say, it was a bigger stake here than Furious 6, which felt more bang- bang than a GOOD movie. If you are looking for little story, more car chases, stupendous action and violence and hot babes, Furious 7 is your ticket. The scenes shot in Dubai are particularly spectacular, with lush resorts, exotic cars being driven off hotel rooftops and crashing into an art gallery, ah! What wonders F7 takes you to! You may know, James Wan from Insidious and Saw, and his crazy camera tricks are highlight here. But it comes with a little compromise, the acting, Diesel feels raw, while Rodriguez feels stale and bland. Walker is great, as usual (R.I.P) Tyrese Gibson is the worst, with his ""cool guy"" attitude and ""bad boy"" cliché character. Overall, this one last trip as Torretto calls it, is refreshing, bang on and full out spectacular. Furious 7 deserves to be watched."
9,"Deckard Shaw(Jason Statham) older to Owen(the villain from the last film) wants revenge on Toretto(Vin Diesel) and his gang for happened in London, and Deckard is a trained military killer and he will stop at nothing. Will Dominic and crew be able to uncover this conspiracy before it's too late? It's a sad note, that Paul Walker died during filming, although his scenes where nearly finished, there where other scenes left to film, they had a body double to stand in, and CGI Paul Walkers face. Although those scenes are pretty obvious. Paul Walker will be surely missed.Paul Walker 1973-2013Action scenes are pretty intense, in films like this you have to suspend a serious of disbelieve. Fight scenes are also great, with each film it gets amped up for the better. Vin Diesel and Jason Statham are great, and there awesome showdown is beyond epic. The other cast members get there chance to shine, nobody really stands out this time. A fight scene between Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey is quite the guilty pleasure. Like I said an action movie for people who like action movies."
9,"Furious 7 is latest movie in the fast and furious series. Furious 7 takes place after fast 3(Tokyo drift), Deckard Shaw is going after the team for revenge of his brother. There is another subplot that's important but overall it's about Deckard Shaw going out for revenge. First off, you can't believe anything that happens in this. Everything they do makes them seem like superheroes. The action is so over the top but it is still so fun to watch. There's also lots of one liners, that Are funny.The cast is great, there are so many people this time like Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Ronda Rousey and lots more. They all have small parts but it's great seeing them in this series. Now the ""team"" is also great. Tyrese Gibson is funny as always. The Rock is in the movie for a little but I wish he had a bigger role in it. Now Paul Walker, it is very sad what happen to him and I feel like the cast and crew of furious 7 did an Amazing job of saying goodbye to Him. He was a great person in and out of movies. Overall furious 7 had lots of crazy and fun moments but had an amazing tribute to Paul. Go and support this movie."
9,"For everyone riding on huge expectations for another mind blowing fast and furious sequel are in for a bit of a disappointment. While some off beat car chases and spectacular camera works around stunts will have you digging into your skin, no doubt, you will feel something missing.James Wan and crew have clearly expressed the loss of their closest member over the course of the movie. Starting with the head on car collisions and the numerous one liners about family to the good five minute tribute that goes out to Paul in the end.You will be reminded of the pain of never being able to see him on screen again. He was spectacular as ever and I have only the best of adjectives to describe how well suited he was for the role and no doubt, more sequels are on the way for the Dominic, Letty and crew but no one can ever reprise the role of Brian O Connor which is why it is justly shown that he retires from all the high octane action to taking care of his family with Mia.There are, of course some of those jaw dropping scenes sprinkled generously in the trailers which will not leave you feeling completely disappointed. James Wan signature rolling the camera along the motion is worthy of mention, what better way to watch Statham and the Rock throwing those punches.But really, your disappointment will quickly be replaced by an emotional melancholy feeling, and it is only fitting.His words to Toretto ""Did you really think I would leave without saying goodbye"" will get to you more than you think it will.Do not miss this one."
9,"The whole process of watching the movie was covered by thought of ""paul walker is no longer around"", especially when he called his wife."
9,"The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way."
9,"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be."
9,"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10"
9,"Still days after seeing it, I'm still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don't see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.
The film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese's best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from ""Taxi Driver"" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from ""The King of Comedy"".
The film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child's hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn't know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother's house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I'm not gonna go any further into plot details since the film's not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn't have the name ""Joker"" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don't get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.
Although I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That's probably my only negative with this film.
But still; it's a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to ""The Killing Joke"" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!
I'm gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix's greatness and even Robert De Niro's acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it's amazing. I can't wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76"
9,"Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses."
9,"Dark, depressing and unsettling film with a haunting score. Incredible acting, directing and screenplay. Joaquin killed it. 5 out of 5 stars! Mental health is so important guys!!!"
9,"Without a doubt, Joker is in contention for the film of the year.With Joachin Phoenix garnering praise left and right for Joker it's easy to dismiss the multiple other elements of direction, sound mixing, editing, cinematography, set and costume design and casting that make this a truly astounding piece of artistic cinema.
Joker is a film that without any one of these elements, it would fail. It would slip into the same bracket as Suicide Squad and be forgotten, but, fail it certainly does not.Joachin Phoenix is phenomenal. We know this already from pictures like Her and The Master, what we didn't know was how utterly deep and broad his range was. At points, I was totally absorbed by Joker. For the first time in possibly 10 years the movie theatre melted away, along with other viewers and noises and I was a part of that film. It was as if I was watching a documentary, rather than a fictional work. His commitment to the role, his weight loss and mental strain are dangerous but it produces something that no one ever thought would happen. It produces a performance that could genuinely rival Heath Ledgers.Todd Phillips direction and script are masterstrokes. If it were a painting it would be a Turner, with bright violent skies, and dark sad landscapes. His beautiful melting pot of inspiration features large doses of Martin Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver', alongside the physiological battery acid from more recent pictures such as Fight Club and Black Swan.
It swirls together to birth this bitter, gritty, dark, mesmerising masterpiece, that both requires and demands, multiple, in-depth viewings.For me, what makes this film is the costume design and the cinematography. The design of every minute detail on each character to make Gotham look even more drab and dull, even more grimy and beaten down is exceptional. Similar to how Scorsese made Harlem and The Bronx look broken and corrupted in Taxi Driver, you feel physically dirty after watching numerous sequences and you feel pangs of genuine social guilt stemming from your own moments of awful selfishness.
The cinematography is astounding, and MUST be in contention for an Academy Award, alongside Best Lead, Best Direction and best Sound Mixing. Some of the shots could have been lifted from a Time Magazine piece on 'City Life' they're that artistically powerful. Whole, dialogue-free sequences that say far more with silence and sounds of a city teetering on the brink of oblivion in the background than anyone could ever say. The sound mixing to have conversations, telephones, car horns, shouting, trains prevalent in the background audio leaking into the foreground does what Nolan did in 'Dunkirk' and pushes further the feeling of strain. The idea that even noise is seeping in from the city and soon the barricade will break and it'll drown us all in it's filth, corruption and decadence.Joker is a true masterpiece. So dark, so dirty, so vindictive of a modern flawed and broken societal system, but it always reminds you:
Put on a happy face."
9,"As an DC fanboy lost hope on DC when they made JL, but i eventually started going back to the cinemas after Wonderwomen and Aquaman. When The Joker film was announced as Joaquin pheonix in the lead i must say i had my doubts. I was pretty sure noone could even match Heath ledger's Joker.. I was wrong. This might be the best DC film ever made! Joaquin pheonix did the impossible. Mindblowing performance as the joker! The best after Heath Ledger! Movie of the year! The laughs, screams, craziness and the dark psychological sufferings of the Joker will haunt you for the rest of the year. I must say The Joker is back! Trust me on this!
9/10 on this one!P.S This is my second 9/10 for a DC movie after TDK."
9,"I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life's simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I'm a happy bunny. I will not let life's current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world's expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger's Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an ""Origins"" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What's his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker's mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It's about ""Why?""And now I see ""Why?""So now ask yourself... ""Why so serious?"""
9,"This film surpassed all other films in portraying the slow descent into madness, caused by biological, psychological, social and familial factors.
It also highlighted the decaying n broken system n society's austerity.
The film is very dark, it has amazing cinematography n this year's best performance by Phoenix.
It has a very surrealistic feel n in fact a solid non horror film which is terrifying n poignant."
9,"Such a different kind of film it's hard to describe, but I'll try. Dark, twisted, humanly relatable, psychotic realism from the point of view of an impoverished society letting its citizens fall through the gaps. It's the perfect combination of uncomfortable, awkward, sad, and funny. I'm pretty sure I felt new untapped emotions without current names, like discovering a new species of animal. It's a work or art, not a super hero of anti-hero movie. Many will be disappointing, as a little of me was, but most of me was very very satisfied. Don't walk there with any expectations, just an open pallet and soak up the paint as it's brushed."
9,"JOKER review:
A brilliant movie. Outstanding Phoenix. Genius Todd Phillips. BEAUTIFULLY HAUNTING."
9,"This movie is slow but never makes you feel bored. The story is narrated in a wonderful manner. This movie sets a good example for others comic based movies that how can a negative character can be portrayed in such a manner that you though know joker in not a good man but will be feeling bad for him at some point.
The acting done by Joaquin Phoenix who played the role of joker was amazing. He was flawless and did proper justice with the character of joker which very few actors were able to do. Joaquin Phoenix is a brilliant method actor.
This is a movie made to see in movie theatre not at tv or any streaming app."
9,"It's pretty apparent the modern generation of critics are here to pader to big dumb billion dollar movies. This is an excellent take on the joker and keeps its focus on a mentally ill mans fall into absolute madness. Its dark and requires attention to follow the plot. Unlike your majority modern movies which tend focus on CGI and explosions with brief plot overviews. It also doesn't try to tick boxes to appease the 1%. It focuses on mental illness and the joker. No LGBTQ, Racism, Gun Control, Police Brutality, Women's issues etc..."
9,"Hildur Guðnadóttir thank you for the amazing soundtrack!!!
Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding. The Joker from a completely different perspective.
He laughs and at the same time he can show all kinds of emotions with his eyes.
Just incredible."
9,Very different from all the past interpretations of the character
9,"I miss Heath Ledger and can't get enough of his portrayal of Joker. He was intimidating, scary, unpredictable and all other things. In 2016, we got Suicide Squad and Jared Leto as Joker both of which disappointed me very much. After that, I thought that I don't want to see another Joker interpretation on the big screen. I was skeptical when I heard that a standalone Joker movie was in works. Then I heard about the casting of Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and I developed an interest in it because I love his work. He is a method actor and has given some of my favorite performances for example in Her (2013) and The Master (2012). I decided to see the movie in the theater after hearing a lot about the movie, good and bad and I am glad that I saw it.This movie is really good, it exceeded my expectations and Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his work. He is phenomenal and I was blown away by his performance. His performance alone carries the whole movie and lets you experience and understand the character without saying much. His physique, movements, gestures, grace, way of speaking suggests that he gave his everything to make the character compelling and stand out from other Joker portrayals. He lost 52 pounds for the role. He embodied the character of Joker. Comparing his performance with Heath Ledger will be absurd. There is no common ground for comparison. Both interpretations of Joker are significantly different, the story is different, character motivations are different.Now talking about the story, this is a standalone Joker movie that shows how a man beaten up, neglected and humiliated by the society turns into a maniac. This movie follows Arthur Fleck who works as a party clown and lives with his mother. He wants to be a stand-up comic. He suffers from a condition causing him to laugh uncontrollably. We feel his loneliness, depression, and condition and sympathize with him for it. All the other performances were also very good. This movie isn't that much violent as people are saying it to be, but it makes you feel the violence and it is unsettling. It also allows the viewer to form their perspective about the character. Sometimes you will agree with his actions and sometimes you won't. There are also certain funny scenes in the movie but not everyone may find it funny.The movie is directed by Todd Phillips and he has done an outstanding job. I didn't think that the guy who made The Hangover movies can pull this off, but he did it. He showed that as a filmmaker, he can make more than just R rated comedies. The film is set in 1981 and the period is very well reflected in the movie. The cinematography is top-notch. Shot composition, camera placement, camera movement has been handled well. I was surprised by how good the Gotham city looked, beautiful and dirty at the same time. Each scene had a color scheme. The lights in the surroundings like light from streetlights, cars or the sky illuminated everything with their light. Joker/Arthur Fleck's emotions get conveyed through shades of light falling on him which is beautiful to look at. Music is beautiful, chilling, hypnotizing and speak lengths about the inner feelings of the character.I have just a few issues with the plot of the movie and how some things happen which shouldn't have happened or couldn't have happened, rest the movie is flawless."
9,"Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we face today in the world. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated and what role we play in helping mentally ill people and how they're treated. The best part about Joker is that it never takes a position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur guðnadóttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is a surreal, out of body experience. Some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance where you don't even wanna blink while watching. And these are just my thoughts on the film, Either way, go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say."
9,"Since Joaquin Phoenix was announced to play the Joker, i was on the front of the hype train and usually that leads to disappointment, but NOT this time!
This movie has such a gritty and realistic attitude towards it that my girlfriend (who has no clue about comics or Batman but i dragged her along into this!) asked me if this was based on a true story.Yes, the similarities to Taxi Driver, Fight Club and The King Of Comedy are obvious, but that doesn't hurt the movie at all. Some things you might see coming, which i usually hate, but this movie manages to leave more questions open, that it answers, so the enjoyment doesnt end when the movie finishes, you can debate about your theories for hours.I keep my reviews always spoiler free, I just wanna mention that I see what you tried here Todd Phillips, this movie is its own sequel - watch it and you'll understandA lovely character study and instant classic that will never get old. 11 years after Heath Ledger, this might be the next Joker that walks away with the little golden man, at least a nomination seems guaranteed!I can't stress enough how much i enjoyed that approach and would love to see more of these kind of movies, because this is what a comic adaptation really deserves."
9,It's such a deep and realistic movie that phoenix deserves an Oscar
9,"Not too much more I can add to the existing reviews. Awesome movie. Acting superb, Phoenix is up there with Heath's. The atmosphere of this movie was so dark and dank. You felt the descent. Good exploration and take on this character whose backstory never seems consistent. This came across less campy than other versions. The cinematography alone was its own separate exhibit at a museum of moving pictures. I don't feel this movie should be missed."
9,"The movie did a great job portraying the creation of the Joker in a relatable, and realistic way. It also helps highlight the importance of mental health and awareness."
9,"This is not a good ""clown"" movie, because it departs from the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the role of the clown, giving the clown a tragic but traceable cause. But this does not prevent the film from becoming a good movie. This is a crime film that is out of the superhero-like surrealism. Mind fucks the audience all the time, until the final climax. The unique performance of Jacques Phoenix gave this clown a tragic artistic personality full of contradictions and pain. I can already foresee him sweeping the awards season. Just like the crime classic ""Taxi Driver"", ""Clown"" is the only choice of this era."
9,"Really beyond expectations. I haven't seen DC Comics. The movie tells the story of the gap between the bottom edge of the society and the rich and the poor from the perspective of clowns. From rhythm to soundtrack to the depth of the story lines, it's very smooth and has a first-class texture. Jack Kun's acting is cracked again, skinny, but explosive."
9,"Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and Todd Phillips as its writer director and producer was not that much convincing for me at first when it was announced. No questions to the Phoenix as an actor but it's the role of Joker bloody Joker which was not a Joke and Todd Phillips the director of Hangover franchise also raised questions as DC is dark and could he pull that off?
Despite of all reservations I would give it to WB's that all the hype they created after the first trailer but still it's about Joker and honestly everyone had their reservations despite of all the hype and a good trailer.
The moment I saw the first scene of the movie where phoenix is doing his makeup of Joker with deliberately making that iconic extended smile with his bare hands on his face, A closeup face shot where suddenly tears started to fall, it took me somewhere else and yes it was just the first scene.
The story shows the late 70's condition of Gotham city where there was economic unrest, income disparity nothing but anger and depression among the general people against the High-class rich people.
The story roams around the Arthur Fleck aka Joker a mentally depressed having pre medical condition and somehow being bullied by everyone he met. The story gets darker and darker as Fleck experiences new traumas each and every day making him nothing but a bizarre cold-blooded maniac we know as ""Joker"" in the end.
Film's direction, tight screenplay, background score and cinematography everything was touching the right notes and was so perfect that it would indulge you so into it and will take your brain and heart in to another universe which is Dark literally Dark.
Despite of everything being perfect i.e. direction, screenplay, background score, cinematography etc. the movie still belongs to Phoenix, he has over shadowed every single aspect of the movie through his effortless and convincing acting. 2 hours 2 mins movie has Phoenix in almost each and every frame and my GOD what he has done is absolutely phenomenal, he has portrayed Arthur Fleck so effortlessly that at some point I started empathizing with the character, the innocence, the simplicity the facial expressions, the physique all will make you connect and fall in love with Arthur.
Phoenix has outclassed each and everything with perfection whether it's bizarre and nervous Laugh, the unique dancing which he is fond of, the diary where he writes whatever he feels and carries with him everywhere he goes. Scenes with the legend Robert De Niro are my personal favorites, first scene where Arthur imagined himself in the late-night show where he interacts with his icon Murray Franklin played by De Niro and the dialogues between them with Arthur being completely honest and innocent was nothing but love and the scene just before climax where Arthur has done taking it and has evolved as The ""JOKER"" actually went to the Murray Franklin's show and confess everything, heated dialogues between Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) and Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) will get into your nerves."
9,"A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering. I loved about every second of it, despite its long runtime."
9,"Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot. Just like the race cars produced by its namesakes, Ford v. Ferrari is sleek and fast; a powerful and expensive machine. A supremely well-balanced combination of corporate rivalry, on-track competitiveness and human drama."
9,"Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases."
9,"Jesus Christ - Bale does it again.Great script, great casting, incredible acting from everyone, but especially Bale."
9,"The Actors were magnificent, fit their characters so well. They're performances added so much to the movie.The story, which obviously is a true tell was emotional and I recommend not looking into anything before seeing the film if you don't know already. Though I'm sure if you know the story you'll still enjoy it.Shot well too. Highly recommend this film."
9,"When you think of great sports movies, Rocky, Remember the titans and Rush comes to your mind. This movie won't be know as the best sports movie of all time but would surely be among the top 20. Everything that needs to be said has already been said about the two leading stars in the movie but big shout out to the supporting cast including Jon Bernthal who was great.The story is good but it's a biographical drama so not much can be changed even though there were few liberties were taken with few facts that were presented.The sound design was excellent which made your heart race faster when you heard the roar of the Ford GT 40!Cinematography by Phedon (who was also the cinematographer for the pursuit of happiness) gives us some nice shots of the race which immerses you into action.I got to watch it as part of secret preview show! It will get few Oscar nominations but doubt it would claim any big prize.
Solid 9 out of 10 for me. A must watch if you are a racing fan or a fan of good sports movie."
9,"Yes indeed, I say it; as good as ""Rush"" (the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda). This movie focuses on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari. And focuses even more on the deal between Carroll Shelby and Mr. H. Ford II. And the driver/mechanic of one of the cars during Le Mans in 1966: Ken Miles.Christian (Bale) and Matt (Damon) are portraying there characters really well. I didn't know that Bale was British, now I know. But either way, every character in the film is believable. The story - based upon real life, so not completely accurate - is entertaining and comes close to the real deal.If you are looking for the real story of the race (and the events towards that) this ain't the movie for you, because it's a movie and not a documentary. And the movie needs to entertain the crowd that is coming towards this piece. So who should watch it ? Autosport fans for sure, Endurance fans absolutely (like myself), car enthusiasts perhaps - depending on which car-class(es).The way they set the whole vibe (I was instantly back at my first trip to Le Mans (2012)). The way they show you the track and the rivalry, and the cars. It's really an awesome movie. Just like Rush. Yes Rush was more about the race, but had also a story but a bit thinner then this one. The story isn't a big one in this one, but it's there. And if you expect a Rush look-a-like you will be sad, so expect more story !I will definitely get this on DVD."
9,"It's not an ""important"" movie, but it's very entertaining and very re-watchable. Matt Damon and Christian Bale give solid performances as usual, as does the rest of the cast. Good direction and I loved the use of the song Polk Salad Annie. I had a minor problem with some aspects of the ending, but nothing worth bringing up."
9,"Frankly speaking, whoever reading this review right now, please stop reading any more reviews wasting your time. Trust me, undoubtedly this movie belongs to the ""Best of 2019"". So what are you waiting for? I bet you won't regret after watching it.Happy watching!!! 🙂"
9,"You don't have to go in with any prior knowledge of vehicles, Ford, or racing history. It may help with feeling more attached to the characters but I feel this movie did a great job with character development. Great sound track. Great racing scenes. Great sound effects. Great acting. I went in expecting a boring ""dad movie"" and when the movie ended I had tears in my eyes and I had a whole new appreciation for the sport. It also felt like a nice history lesson. Don't do any prior research to the film and go in with an open mind, and enjoy the amazing performances by Christian Bale and Matt Damon."
9,Excellent acting by the entire cast. The race scenes convey the power and danger of the races.
9,It was an excellent movie with remarkable acting of Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Ford Vs Ferrari was one of the best movies of 2019. But in my opinion it deserved more than 4 oscar nominations.
9,Breath of fresh for the film industry. Really enjoyed this one... I regret watching it on a small screen!!!
9,"After being very behind with film watching and reviewing, a lot of my reviews this year being dedicated to individual episodes of shows, completest quests and some cartoons, finally made the decision to watch more films released this year and to finally review the films seen earlier this year but hadn't gotten round to seeing. 'Le Mans 66' was a very eagerly anticipated film, due to liking the lead actors and loving 'Rush' that this has been compared to by some, and one of the year's (quite hit and miss) more acclaimed films, so there was not any doubt about seeing it.'Le Mans 66' (often advertised though under the easier to remember title of 'Ford v Ferrari') doesn't disappoint a vast majority of the time, almost everything is right with it. Found it an exceptionally well made, acted, written and enthralling film and one of the year's must sees, also one of the few films this year where the advertising actually did it justice which is such a rarity in film (having lost count of the number of great films that were criminally mismarketed or misleadingly so). Seeing as 2019 has been another hit and miss year, with a fair share of good to brilliant films, a fair share of mediocre films or less (including clunkers) and films sitting in between, that is saying a fair bit actually and am not trying to sound like a snob here.It isn't without its flaws, though they are hardly any. Did find the character of Peter and his scenes rather too twee for my liking, like when the film cutaways to him where he pointlessly explains the action. 'Le Mans 66' already had a lot of emotional impact of all kinds, the character and his presence just didn't seem necessary.Maybe it is a little too long too, it could easily have done with being perhaps 15 minutes shorter and lessening or excising Peter's role would have made things better.However, 'Le Mans 66' looks great. Especially the editing, which is actually quite astonishing in the action-oriented scenes and can see some kind of nod for Best Editing at any of the big awards. Likewise with the sound editing, which is quite striking in its authenticity, 'Le Mans 66' capturing the spirit of the sport and the personal lives behind it beautifully. James Mangold's direction is stylish throughout, the action-oriented scenes have plenty of thrills and mostly the personal lives scenes are emotionally investable.Script is tightly structured and is nicely balanced. The story is always well balanced and some twee moments aside is always compelling. The climactic race is absolutely thrilling in every sense of the word. All the performances are spot on, with Matt Damon giving one of his better and most good-natured performances and Tracy Letts excels in his role, especially in his post-drive breakdown and his frankness during the Ford executive presentation. Best of all is Christian Bale in the film's most demanding role, he captures the uncomprimising attitude needed brilliantly.All in all, excellent and one of 2019's highlights when it comes to film. 9/10"
9,"If you're not a car/racing nut, don't be put off by the title. Even though the storyline is about the real life battle between the two car giants, the best thing about this film is Damon's and Bale's on-screen friendship, the cherry on the cake being Christian Bales portrayal of Ken Miles. I couldn't stop watching this film and everytime I grinned from ear to ear. I'm glad I saved it for watching during the Covid lockdown."
9,The first half an hour I was thinking how long is this movie. Then I looked back down and an hour and half had passed and was ready for more. You get so involved into the movie the real world melts away. This hasn't happened in a long time. You will be entertained!
9,"Laugh, cry, get the feels, this movie has it all. Christian bale shines as always and Matt damon loves chewing gum. I wonder what kind of gum he was chewing for 78% of the movie. Anyway it was great I just thought that was funny. If you love cars it's a plus. I almost skeeted my pants like 4 times during this movie."
9,"You know the best part of the whole movie? It's not Bale, Damon or the cars. They and the cars are already on the respected list. It's the ""background music"". Every time BGM began, it pumped me up. My adrenaline rush felt amazing. It makes any car/bike enthusiast, respect their ride. I had some good cars and I'm missing them all so much right now. Returning back home from the movie, the music in my car was all the way to the sky and I sat for another few mins in the car even after reaching my destination. This is what the movie did to me.Peace out!"
9,"Great script. Great chemistry. A great ""buddy"" movie, but so much more. 2.5 hours will fly by so fast!"
9,"Visually stylish, gorgeously filmed and with a fantastic soundtrack.
I really am not a big fan of motor racing but this kept me enthralled from beginning to end.
The real life events have been manipulated somewhat for entertainments sake but the result is so good that hardly matters.
Best film I've seen for years"
9,"I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of ""Ford v Ferrari"". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.One of the main strengths of ""Ford v Ferrari"" is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of ""big corporation screwing over the little guy"" thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.There's also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to ""Ford v Ferrari"". It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn't a comedy. It's long, but doesn't feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present."
9,"There is a lot of good in this movie but for me by far the best is the performance by Christian Bale. He is faultless in this move, even down to the subtly Brummie twang and expressions. Very believable.The actions keeps you on the edge of your seat and even though you probably know the story beforehand, its delivery is superb."
9,"Ford V Ferrari is an excellent biopic movie into the lives of Ken miles and Carroll Shelby. The film is able to beautifully weave their tales without showing anything unnecessary to us and making us truly care for their characters and their race to beat Ferrari. Both Chrisitian Bale & Matt Damon give excellent performances that bring their characters to life. The racing scenes as well are understandably very good giving alot of tension and action to the movie. This is truly a movie to watch and trust me on this, even if you are not a big car fan (like me), you will still enjoy this. I guarantee it."
9,"Loved this move.More or less historically aligned, if not entirely accurate.However, great acting, some humour and lots of cars ... from start to finish."
9,I loved it was intense and exciting at the same time the cast was great and the car scenes where great to the racing was amazing I loved it considering I grew up loving cars Ford vs Ferrari gets a 9-10 perfect movie great racing
10,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the seventh installment of this successful franchise but I was totally blown away by the seamless and well choreographed fight scenes and car chases. What makes this movie stand out from its predecessors is how it goes beyond the modding of Japanese street cars to engaging the viewer with a very decent storyline that pulls together all of the previous movies. I particularly liked the use of the cut-scenes from previous films that reminded viewers of the continuity of one helluva story.Of course, the other side of going to see this movie was knowing the loss of its prime star - Paul Walker - to a shocking car accident last year, and wondering how much of a role he would play in the film and how well they would work their CGI magic into his role. Needless to say, it was very well done (even though you could tell when they did use CGI of his face in a few scenes).Not trying to give anything away, but the final 5 minutes was a fitting send off for Paul. I'm sure there was a few takes for the final scene on the beach.Great film. 10/10 from me."
10,"fast and furious series is not made to get Oscars or golden globes these movies are made for the young people to have a thrill and bang for their money.This movie has all the youth asks for Action, very little drama,hot babes in bikinis, car chases and of course the stuff getting blown up to pieces. if you are a young person between 18 to 28 you'll love it and if you young by heart you'll adore it.but if you are looking for award winning performances this wont be the movie for you so critics might not like it for having the same old chase and kill concept of action movies but youth will love it because they once more saw their favorite actors do what they do best.drive cars and then do whats unthinkable. also to add as this movie is like a tribute to the passing of Paul walker(R.I.P.)they have managed to put on the best farewell moments for him using CGI and body doubles of course and i think think movie justifies it very much.so go on watch this movie i bet you'll feel nostalgic all over again and also in the end you might end up in tears so do bring the tissues with you"
10,"The Fast Furious franchise has come a far way, and this particular movie is far the best one. It is packed full of action, comedy and amazing cars. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who loves fast furious. The movie follows Tokyo Drift so it would be a good idea to watch all the movies again before watching this one. The ending is great and overall i think the director and the actors have done a great job!! Tyrese Gibson is one heck of a funny actor, Vin Diesel has done a great job in his role, So has Jordana Brester, Dwayne Johnson, Ludicrous and Jason Statham in his great role as the antagonist in the film. Tje plot of the story is great. I was hoping for another movie of ff8 but however i think it was appropriate for the team to stop here as it would be quite disrespectful to make another one without Paul Walker."
10,"So last night we finally watched the latest installment of the Fast Saga:Fast and Furious 7. In September 2013 Paul Walker died during the filming of ""Fast & Furious 7″ in a car accident. To honor him the film was completed with a modified script. The result is not only a furious action blockbusters, but also a worthy memorial to this deceased star. While Walker had already shot most of his scenes to complete the film, for the remaining parts Walkers brothers Caleb and Cody had been used in some scenes with CGI and body doubles. In the end the additional work and time spend on this was very well worth it. The fact that one of the main characters was killed during the shooting of this movie won't be noticed in the film until the very appropriate sentimental end.With its great charm, wit and attention to detail ""Fast & Furious 7″ is a perfected action blockbuster. The greatest strength of the film is in my opinion that it never takes itself too serious despite its sad history. If you are a moviegoers that values a sophisticated and logical plot development and a realistic representations you are wrong here. This movie got hyperbole wherever you look, but that is not a negative thing in my opinion.Compared to the previous installments ""Fast & Furious 7″ tops the predecessors in all respects and goes the extra mile. You see tuned cars drop out of a plane, drivers changing cars during full speed (several times) or crashing though the window of one Abu Dhabi Skyscraper only to end up in a neighboring skyscraper again. Epic.Especially the scene where the wounded agent Hobbs dismisses himself from Hospital with the words ""Daddy has to work"" by blowing up his plaster arm by flexing his biceps may soon gain cult status. In addition to the well-known stars of the previous movies, including the spin offs ""Tokyo Drift"", the cast was even expanded by by two high-calibers starring Jason Statham and Kurt Russell who present themselves in top form and as a valuable addition to the movie.You can tell that for everyone involved in the movie it was a matter of the heart to put Paul Walker the worthy monument that is Fast and Furious 7. For me this latest installment is till date by far the strongest film in the series and despite the tragic circumstances a huge fun ride."
10,"Amazing tribute to Paul walker, And what a wonderful memory of him... the Movie still stands in my eyes.. Amazing, extraordinary.. Some movies only stand in our eyes and this movie is.. The whole cast is marvelous and each and every minute of the film was written well... Pin Diesel stands back for family.. Paul as his brother.. Superb Ending.. I liked it.. The best movie of the decade.. Paul is amazing to watch in the screen as a father , brother.. Gibson is in his comic sense and the air diving and the stunts are .. Whooah.. One Last Ride.. Jason Statham blocks Rock.. Paul Drives.. Michelle is amazing.. Samma.. The team has really made a great effect.. For Paul.."
10,"***WARNING! This review contains spoilers, if you haven't seen this film, you might want to before reading this review!*** Now, that I have watched the highly-anticipated feature film in the Fast & Furious film saga, this seventh installment was released on April 3rd, 2015 to extremely positive reviews and eventually broke the $1 billion dollar mark in three weeks after it's April 3rd release against a over extended budget of $250 million dollars over the unexpected tragic death of Paul Walker, who died on November 30, 2013.With the previous installments being set between 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, this seventh Fast and Furious film, now titled just ""Furious 7"" is the first film of the series to mostly take place after the third film.I'm gonna try and explain the plot in the best way that I can without making anyone sad.After defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and clearing their records, Dominic Toretto, Letty Ortiz, Brian O'Conner and the rest of the crew are able to return to the United States and live normal lives again. Brian begins to deal with fatherhood, while Dominic helps Letty regain her memory. Owen's other brother, Deckard Shaw breaks into the secure hospital the comatose Owen being held in and swears vengeance against Dom. The crew goes to Han's funeral and both Shaw and Toretto prepares to fight but they don't. Hobbs and Shaw enters a fight, but Hobbs is injured and rushed to the hospital by Elena Neves.This leads into the Toretto house being blown up and a man named Frank Petty informs Dom that he will help him in stopping Shaw's plan if he gets something called the God's Eye, a computer device that can track a specific person and the creator, Megan Ramsey. They go to Abu Dhabi, where they get the flash drive with the God's Eye.This leads into a very, very long car chase and a final fight ensues between Dominic and Deckard in a Street Fighter-like type. Hobbs then come and shoots and kills Jakande. When Dom remains unconscious, the team fears that he is dead. As Letty cradles his body, she reveals that they are married and she has regained her memories and Dom soon regains consciousness. Later, Deckard is locked away in a CIA person and Dominic and his crew realizes that Brian is better off with his family. In the final scene, Dom and Brian drives up at a stop sign. As Dom remembers the times that he has had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drives off in separate directions.I'm not gonna spend all my time on this film, but this film is the best of the Fast & Furious series, along with the first film, the second film, the third, fifth and sixth film.The comedy and drama is really well-thought out and director James Wan and Chris Morgan deserves a lot of credit for picking up where this film left off in the previous film. The film does not feel like it is long at all, it feels like it's an hour and a half long and at 134 minutes, some people say it is the longest, but it really isn't.The action is just incredible and this movie has a lot of action. The fight between Kara and Letty is well choreographed and done carefully. The car chases are just as intense and action-packed as they are in the other films in the series. The fight between Dominic and Deckard Shaw rips off Street Fighter: The Video Game, but I like how it turns out and the way the two jumps to each other to fight with car tools is beautifully shot and pretty.The music by Brian Tyler is just emotionally powerful, intense and super-cool. The acting is just incredible and powerful. Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster as Dominic Toretto, Letty Ortiz and Mia Toretto are all really great in their performances in the film. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson as Tej and Roman are just as funny and serious as they were in 2 Fast 2 Furious, Fast Five and the previous film, Furious 6. Jason Statham is okay as Deckard Shaw. Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs is incredible in this film. The other actor I will definitely mention is the late Paul Walker, in his final film appearance ever as Brian O'Conner, for the seventh and final time is just sad, emotional and really great and I'm really glad that his young brothers Caleb and Cody, finished his remaining scenes. The send-off they give for his character is just sad, even with the Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth original song, ""See You Again"" song playing at the end and the montage of scenes from the previous movies in the franchise.Overall, I love FURIOUS 7. It can get sad at the end, but I still love the heck out of this movie and I have no problem seeing the next film, but I am sad that this is Paul Walker's last film appearance and really great performances and it is a well done film.I'm giving it an 10 out of 10."
10,"I went expecting big things from this movie, and unsurprisingly I was not surprised. This movie was everything that I was expecting. From cars, to guns, to strong female characters (I.E the beautiful and talented Michele Rodriguez and Rhonda Rousey, amongst many others.) The guys were also great, with. Vin diesel, djimon Honsou and Jason statham (all actors I have liked watching in other films they have done.) Dwayne Johnson pulling out the big guns. I really would recommend this movie and I did appreciate the farewell they gave 'the late' Paul walker at the end of the film. I do think that he will be missed by so many who have watched his films. R.I.P Mr walker. Hoping their might be something else this great group of actors can do together in the future."
10,"Well... well.. well..... Let's see Everyone knows how traumatic it was to lose an actor and a person like Paul Walker. Specially for the Fast & Furious team. It cannot be described in words or any other means. However the way this film has paid a tribute to him is something which every actor wants living or dead. Movie is simply awesome and there is no question about it. The reason simply being it was not complete when Paul was taken away from us and the story writer and director must have been in terrible agony then. But the way everything has been put together not a single soul can believe what they just saw after watching this movie. However I was reading comments and reviews from other users and I find it sad to see that people don't give importance to little but important things in a movie. For instance I was shocked to see Tony Jaa in this movie. There is a full on action sequence where he is literally making an Ong Bak 4 out of this movie but people didn't find time to write about him. I think he was simply awesome. The best thing about this movie is Jason who is simply a Pit Bull from UK, a live time bomb, the transporter who can transport you to hell in no time and a very dangerous Killer elite in one... So my recommendation to people would be, pay a tribute to Paul, go and watch this movie.... For Paul"
10,"James Wan did a really good job. :)A good movie keeps you excited at first, WOW in the middle & OMG in the end. & this is exactly what you will get in this movie. Furious 7 is so wild, engaging & exciting from the beginning till the very end.There is all in one movie,,,action ,love story, comedy omg. some scenes were so funny that everyone were laughing in the movie theater. It's totally unbelievable how a car chasing movie like Fast & Furious could lead to a mind blowing actions movie, & it gets better from scene to scene. What a good way to end & remember Paul. You'll be missed, Paul Walker! I admit i was crying in the end, so for those who loved Paul, you will cry....i guarantee it :)"
10,"When you watch a movie you must know the type of the movie like the Fast and Furious franshine that its all about cars and stunts and action , I am a huge fan of the franshine since Fast Five and its keep growing bigger and bigger for example they destroy 200 cars for a bank vault in Fast Five then in Furious 6 they got a Tank then what they want to do something bigger !they drop a real cars with parachutes !!! This is why i love this franshine because the amazing stunts ... Furious 7 like the previous two the story is stupid and over the top but the stunts are amazing and they destroy 230 cars for the movie like Maserate 2014 and Aston Martin Db9 2008 and Nissan Gtr 2012 and Lykan Hypersport 2014 and many many cars ... and the beginning of the movie is solid when Jason Statham (Deckard shaw) is talking to his brother Owen shaw after he kills the black ops guys and destroy the hospital and the soundtrack (Payback) was amazing And the first chase sequences between Dom and Deckard it was amazing and end with a huge collision then Mr.nobody come and save Dom and he wanted him for a mission to a bring Ramsay The Hacker because she created a device that find anybody in the world and to find shaw .at this point the story become a rescue mission than a revenge plot ... and the mountain scenes is the best in the movie because great stunts and cameras work and they destroy 50 cars for that scenes ... and in Abu Dahbi we saw The Lykan Hypersport jumping between two towers and it was fantastic... and we saw another chase sequences Between Dom and Deckard this time Dom with his iconic muscle car the Beast Dodge Charger 1970 and Shaw with the British car Aston Martin Db9 2008 and end with a collision but this time the Charger win ... at the end Deckard Shaw goes to secured prison and of curse he will back in Furious 8. and despite his short time in the movie. Jason Statham was a Badass Villain and i hope he gets more time in Furious 8... And of curse we don't forget Tony jaa he was amazing in his tow fight scence with Paul walker but unfortunately he die. and Ronda Rousy also her fight scence with Letty was greet ... and the final tribute for Paul walker was amazing and emotional and the Wiz khalifa song see you again make you cry and forgot the movie , and we saw a final ride between Dom charger and Paul walker real car Toyota Supra ... So for me Furious 7 is the best one in series i know it over the top but the Cars and Stunts and Action is the best in while....."
10,"I had to admit that this was the best movie in the Fast & Furious franchise. James Wan had done a terrific direction and the cast were just a perfect team. The movie was the final movie of late Paul Walker and I am happy to see his last movie which is fantastic. After the success of The Conjuring, Director James Wan has not let me down with the movie. The stunts were fantastic, the views were amazing and acting was above all. The movie is a great tribute to Paul Walker. Apart from regular characters, Jason Statham who played the villanious role of Deckard Shaw did justice with his role. The movie was overall a brilliant one under great direction. This is a must watch for every action movie lovers. This is the best movie I have seen so far in 2015. I go with 10/10 for this fantastic and stunning action movie."
10,"This was sold as One Last Ride. And it felt just like that. Throughout the film, you get the feeling that this is the finale for this incredible franchise.It paid incredible homage to the previous installments. From characters, to story lines, everything seemed to come full circle. Even some of the sequences made you flash back to when you first saw something identical or similar years ago.It reminded us of why we love every character tied to this franchise, present and past.As someone who quite literally grew up with these movies, I feel like I have closure. I don't need another one. I've watched every Fast and Furious movie dozens of times each, hundreds total. I used to looks forward and impatiently wait for the next movie. With this one, that urge is gone. The journey feels complete. It was our last ride.Faced with the huge challenge of finishing this movie without Paul, I think everyone involved with this movie made all of the right moves, all the way up to the very end. It did Paul Walker justice."
10,I became a car enthusiast when the first F&F came out. I will always love this franchise. Its was heart pounding and you always were on the edge of your seat. I look for ward to the 8th installment. I don't want to give any spoilers away so i wont. If you love cars and have been in the car sense you will love this film. ever since the first film racewars became a real thing in the USA. This movie was change the way i live my life some of the codes in the movie i follow in real life. I hope they keep making Fast and the furious even if it get to fast and the furious fifty i will still watch them thank you to all the cast and people that make these films possible. like i said they have changed my life and always will keep these movie in my life and commuitys thanks again
10,"Fantastic Movie. Nice direction. Paul's action was fabulous. Fans might just love his scenes. Tyrese Gibson looks like a joker in this film. Routine revenge story but its shown in a different way. Jason once again gave his best like a villain. Dialogues are really good. Cars!! The Upgraded ones. Music was just awesome. Last 5mins of the movie before the end credits, the scenes appear like they are dedicated to Paul. Really we miss Paul Walker.Ride out song and Go hard or go home songs are played with end credits.The last song Before end credits shown like Paul and Vin Diesel go for ride is something heart touching,you might feel to cry if you are a Paul Walker Fan."
10,"Fast & Furious has become a huge recognizable name in action, today it stands as a huge box-office hit for distributor Universal Studios. With this anticipated seventh installment, they have pulled out the big guns on action, fun and surprisingly emotion as the series reaches new heights and its trademarks that make it recognized. The film lifts off where the previous 6th outing left, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and crew are home in America having securing their amnesties and living their lives in peace with loved ones: with Toretto still helping his love Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) regain her memories and O'Connor adjusting to fatherhood to his growing son. But this peace will be shattered when one of their own is killed by the target cross-eye of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is avenging his brother's demise.James Wan may be known for his contributions to horror-thriller genre (Insidious, The Conjuring, Saw and Death Sentence) but his direction and view of an action genre film is indeed an strong impression that left me and audiences in excitement. Wan proves that action is driven on speed, choreography and style and this makes F&F7 a worthy example of this. The action sequences are all big, loud and pack plenty of eye candy for action fans; from a rescue mission on a moving bus, building jumping, shootouts, fistfights and an explosive climax that takes place in an urban city. Practical stunts, assisting CGI and well-choreographed eye on detail make F&F7 worthy contender for visual effects and stunt awards in the coming year.Casting as always is close and fun in the F&F series, with Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, Gibson, Bridges, Brewster and Johnson sharing the leading formula that makes their characters seem so likable, with Johnson, Russell, Hounsou, Emmanuel and Statham proving great supporting roles. But sadly here it is final acting appearance of the late Paul Walker (who had died in an unexpected event) which left the film in a stand-still and its cast and fans worldwide in deep sadness. The film was delayed for a year and a half but the result was something that would touch not only the audience but its crew and cast. The final scene indeed left people crying in the theater but it was a touching and emotionally connected moment that hasn't been seen in film in some years, it made me feel both sad and touched and feeling that the F&F series had ended perfectly as it won't be the same without Walker.Pros: + Exciting action sequences that overthrow the over-the-top action seen in the previous installment. Fast cars, mega destruction, brutal fistfights and big guns make it seem an action lover's wet dream+ Improvement on plot, using the trademark franchise style that has overtaken since the 4th installment) and this story line is need more exciting and entertaining than any of the previous films+ The final tribute to Paul Walker was touching, moving and something that makes the series end on a beautiful noteOVERALL: Fast & Furious 7 is not only a fast driven action ride but in terms of quality, production value and emotion it proves to be the best of the series and one of this year's best films to have seen. It's only a thought now to see how Mad Max: Fury Road (releasing on May 14th 2015) will overthrow the action and car stunts that F&F7 has established a strong impression among audiences, but regardless this film will indeed be on your to 'see list'. Walker would have been deeply proud of how the film turned out in the end."
10,"The movie Fast and Furious 7 is an amazing action filled movie! This movie illustrates how much family is valued and what family actually means. Fast and Furious 7 demonstrates that family isn't just blood; family is who sticks by your side. The way the director James Wan and the editing crew Leigh Folsom Boyd, Dylan Highsmith, Kirk Morri, Christian Wagner, they made it so Paul Walker's brother Cody played his part,and they digitally put Paul's face over Cody's, to make it seem like Paul Walker was still in the movie. If you have seen the first six Fast and Furious movies, I would highly suggest you see this one, but be ready, you will need some tissues at the end! The cast of Fast and Furious 7 said that it was from Walker and Fast and Furious 8 is for (Paul). This movie portrayed how much their lives have changed over the years. I went with my family to see this movie and I would recommend it to any family who loves action, or has seen the previous six movies. This movie will not disappoint you! It will make you want to watch the next one and see what happens next! It will leave you filled with suspense and will make you value family more. The end of the movie will bring you to tears, as Vin Diesel says to Paul ""I used to say I live my life a quarter mile at a time and I think that's why we were brothers - because you did too. No matter where you are, whether it's a quarter mile away or halfway across the world, you'll always be with me. And you'll always be my brother.""If action-filled movies are what you enjoy, I highly suggest this movie! This movie will have you on the edge of your seat with excitement, fear, sadness all packed into two hours. You will be left in suspense and will be valuing family a whole lot more. This movie earns five stars in my books."
10,"These franchise had got me sense of speed in every aspects of life. And the starting film where Paul entered was a memory for life. After hearing his tragic death I was compelled to watch this movie. The last scene got me to tears when I re looked the old film clips of Paul's films.This film gave tribute to the legendary actor at every occasion,be it with Dom, Mia, or with whole family. May be he is no more but his daring movies and true nature will be remembered by every movie going person for long time.MISS YOU PAUL WALKER."
10,"movie was awesome lots of packed action, and the hot girls were awesome wish i could date them and be together and do stuff with them, you know what i mean and the music was cool too loved it all, even know when me and my friend watched it on DVD, it kept stuffing up the part i saw were cool, and would watch it again all the way to the top,i hope they make a 8 one, because that would be cool to see it without Paul walker, let try it see how it goes i never seen any of the other ones but might think about seeing it, but really loved the movie to bits and am happy i saw it, i know one boy who loves this movie and that what made me want to see it, and now i have."
10,"Wonderful. I got to see one of the advanced screenings and it was everything you have come to expect from the franchise. I don't know if this is exactly a spoiler per se, but just in case I'm marking it as one! (spoiler spoiler! Describing the tone at the end!)What I didn't expect was what a touching and sentimental tribute to Paul Walker it would be. Everyone, including the very burly macho dudes sitting near me, were in tears at the end. Half the audience was sobbing. The only reason I gave it a 9/10 is because it was emotionally exhausting! I think the ending to the previous movie was a lot more exciting and got your blood pumping, whereas this ending required the entire credits sequence for the theater to put themselves back together again. We were all a bunch of superfans, so we were probably more attached to Paul than the average movie-goer, so your experience may be less overwrought with emotions."
10,"By far one of the best films I've ever watched, doesn't disappoint from the previous 6! Watched it last night for the first time and I was extremely impressed! I think if you're a fan of the previous films, this one definitely deserves to be watched. The storyline is easy to follow, full of amazing action shots(no spoilers). I for one seriously cannot wait until the release of the ones to come in future. Although I didn't watch it in cinema, I felt the full affect of the clarity of the characters, it was an amazing film, I cannot express it enough. Many people expect disappointment due to Paul Walker's death, yet they managed to take it into a consideration of a big part of the film which made me both cry and happy at the same time."
10,"Furious 7 is the newest of the Fast and Furious sequels. It is an action film in which you see how street racers live. The main actor is Vin Diesel (Dom Torreto) he is the leader of the gang his girlfriend is Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) and also one of the main characters Paul Walker (Brian) the are other characters Dwayne Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, Kurt Russel, Jordana Brewster and Jason Statham the villain (Deckard Shaw). In the movie you follow Dom Torreto and the gang who are trying to live a normal life now until Deckard Shaw decides to seek after revenge for his brother. The action takes place all over the world and its very fast paced but in the end Torreto and the gang stay alive and but Shaw in prison. The movie was amazing the special effects were great that is something that really made this film awesome I also loved the characters and the revenge seeking villain was amazing. Overall this movie was great and I loved it i would recommend it to everyone to watch however you really have to watch the other parts to know what is going on."
10,The opening scene in the movie showed Jason Statham who should be the main villain but his character was not shown much power after the terrorist showed up. Like always Vin diesel's entry was good. The digital face making of Paul was an excellent job. The action sequence from the Ehthiad towers was mind blowing. For me it was the best scene. The ending part was too long nd at some point it was like when is this gonna end. But the way they ended the movie with a Paul Walker tribute was epic. Many of them cried at his short video...Me too. I I hope there will be a continuation to this movie because till now Jason Statham is not killed he is just prisoned and the way they showed his character i think there will be and 8 part waiting for Fast and Furious Fans #forpaul #rippaul
10,"Even i have never see the other Fast & Furious films series to know the story line. Even it has the many Clichés of Action Films. But for what it is,is a Pretty Awesome Film (Especially for the Series)If you not are fan of this series,that OK (but don't you dare to say something bad about Paul Walker) If you are not familiar of the series i cant help you with that ,all i can do is tell you to see the films seriesThis film is still on Theaters so i am not going to spoiler most of the middle & the ending because is really worth it to see it with out knowing much.So what is so good about this film? Let's have a lookStory:This film taking place after Fast & Furious 6 Ending. In this one is about Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for the death of his brother and that is the hull story ,is the hull revenge story cliché and well it really works for this film because the main villain of this film is really good ,you know why is angry and why he want to kill Dominic Toretto and his family the story it has is really sad and you fell so sorry about this guy. speaking of whichCharacters:Most are the original actors you like of this series are still here and we also have some new actors in this film and all of them are awesome. But let's talk about the big once (in my opinion) and that is Jason statham & paul walker Jason play as the main new villain of this series it was really cool in this roll,i was a little afraid it was going to sting in the roll of a villain because i have never see him play the roll of a villain but after i watch this film it was awesome in this roll it was a really good choice i enjoy every min of him. Paul play as Brian it was also really good and it was a good thing to see him one last time,i was really worried what are they going to do here because Paul died before will make the news there going to do other Fast & Furious ,to make a film without one one of main actor it was impassable but what they did,they have done amazing job. As for the rest of the others they all great and they did amazing job too. (and as for Nathalie Emmanuel is really hot)CGI:The CGI is Unbelievably Awesome if i watch this film on 3D it will way more awesome & look really real. This one has the most awesome car chases,the best fight scenes & the most awesome action scenes of this series.(in my opinion) My favorite of them all is when the fall of a plane and they were after a truck with mini-guns.Overall this new one of this series is in my opinion the best of this series and it is really enjoyable to watch it with friends and 3D when he come on 3D. Even it has a lot of the clichés we see in other action films,it makes something new and fresh to be enjoyable & watchable AND MOST IMPORTANT IT USE PAUL WALKER PERFORMANCE RESPECTFULLY THAT FOR THE FANS IT GOING TO BE WONDERFUL.5/5 10/10 98/100 and 5 stars and will give it 5 Oscars to use the death Actor Performance respectfully"
10,"With still having strong memories of being left absolutely terrified by Insidious,I was thrilled to discover that director James Wan's first full-on non-Horror title would be the latest Fast & Furious film.After waiting an extra year to see the movie, (due to the tragic death of lead actor Paul Walker)me and a friend decided to buckle up for a fast & furious midnight screening.The plot:Finding his brother (who tried to bomb London) Owen Shaw to be left near dead in a hospital,former special operatives agent Deckard Shaw decides to get revenge on the gang who have attacked his family. Going to Tokyo,Deckard tracks gang member Han down in a street race and kills him.Wanting to make an entrance,Deckard sends a bomb to Brian O'Conner and his family,which they barely escape from being killed.Horrified about the attack on his friends, Dominic Toretto receives a call from Deckard,who reveals that he is going to kill them all.Furious over the brutal killing of Han,Toretto decides that he must stop Deckard before he strikes again.As Toretto and his friends set their sights on getting revenge,they are shocked to find out that Deckard has decided to wipe them out by teaming up with a ruthless war lord.View on the film:Facing the challenge of ending the movie on a tribute to Paul Walker,the screenplay by returning writer Chris Morgan ends the movie on a poetic note,with the films theme of ""family"" avoiding the risk of being cheesy,by Morgan making the films final moments be filled with a real sense of warmth & sincerity.Along with the graceful tribute,Morgan makes the epic 2 and a half hour (!) running time speed pass,by giving each member on the heroes & villain's sides their unique moment to shine,from Toretto's wife Letty helping the team members successfully escape,to Deckard henchmen Kiet being set on killing O'Conner.Keeping the titles pulse running,Morgan lights the screen with an extraordinary cartoon atmosphere,which jumps from parachuting cars to drone hacking around LA with an infectious passion.Making his first,full-on non-Horror movie,director James Wan displays an impressive confidence,with Wan using tightly held close shots,which allow the viewer to clearly see ever punch & street turn taking place.Despite a change in genre,Wan skilfully adapts his Horror film style,thanks to Wan using long,winding tracking shots which strike the action scenes with a full force,and also using minimal lighting in confrontation scenes,which give the title a tense,brittle atmosphere.Entering the series as its first returning villain, Jason Statham gives a strong performance which gives the baddies their strongest presence in the entire series,thanks to Stratham giving the movie a shot of vengeful anger,as Deckard aims to take all of Toretto's pals down,whilst Tony Jaa marks his English-language debut as quick- witted baddie Kiet.For his last ever performance,Paul Walker gives a charming performance as Brian O'Conner,with Walker giving Conner a real sense of a close friendship with Toretto.Delivering the final lines in the title, Vin Diesel gives a wonderful performance as Dominic Toretto,thanks to Diesel perfectly balancing a frantic energy to the action scenes,with a quiet melancholy mood to the loss of a loyal ""family"" member."
10,"I watched this movie first day, first show. It started with a bang and ended with a bang, and in a way that would have crumbled even hearts of steel.This has everything one might need in a blockbuster movie. There were smoking hot chicks, electrifying dialogs, fantastic humor, awe inspiring stunts, and a menacing addition - Jason Statham.This is a movie which you dare not miss, because if you miss this one you are never going to see another. Be prepared for one last lovely beautiful and thrilling ride ahead of you, that's well worth your time and memories.In terms of cast and crew, Vin Diesel proves to be the man of the series aided by brilliant performances by Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Jordana Brewster, and Dwayne Johnson. And finally the unforgettable Paul Walker. Walk into the sunset, walk through the rain... Walk straight into our hearts, and never abandon our memories again. For Paul... May your soul rest in Peace."
10,"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema."
10,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
10,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
10,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
10,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
10,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
10,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"
10,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it."
10,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
10,"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.
To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience."
10,"I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his ""small"" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October."
10,"This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you."
10,"The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh."
10,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
10,I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.
10,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.
I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!"
10,"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both."
10,"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8."
10,"The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity""
& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.
Choreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.
The cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.
Edit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!."
10,"Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down."
10,"The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don't have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a ""good boy"". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker's life, I begin to get it."
10,"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.
Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.
Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.
I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.
Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away
1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker."
10,"Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10"
10,"Masterpiece of a movie and the best performance of all time by Joaquin Phoenix. Great, suspenseful movie that keeps you on edge and definitely deserves all of the awards it has received."
10,"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy
Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene"
10,"This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema ."
10,"I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars."
10,"Rating 10/10
Inspired movie of the year. It is wonderfully made. A good story well told. Tightly written, well acted and directed. I hope Matt Damon and Christian Bale can winning an oscar awards because he already deliver the character very well. Thank you to all of you because make it this movie so amazing . A masterpiece !!"
10,"Just saw F v F at the Telluride Film Festival and it is phenomenal. Perfect performances, incredible visuals and editing, immersive sound, and a riveting story. A real winner. Christian Bale lost 70 pounds Defoe the role and is a delight. Damon is spot on. Catriona Balfe is excellent. All the actors playing Ford executives are excellent as well. Masterful direction from James Mangold. A must see."
10,"I attended the screening at Fox Studios yesterday and It was so good I want to see it again in IMAX. Christian Bale deserves an Oscar nom and definitely so far, the Best Film of the Year!"
10,Both Matt Damon and Bales performances were fantastic and brilliantly directed by James ( by far his best directed film to date!)Along with the excellent duo Oscar worthy performances the racing sequences were upmost beautifully made along with the films cinematography!Im fully confident and expecting multiple Oscar nominations on all fronts for this joyful movie!!
10,"I like the movie a lot, one of the best in so much a long time, the two lead actors nailed their roles and the story line is so good, effects and CGI are both great and the movie pretty much tells a story of faith and hard work on top of talent."
10,Honestly I went to watch this movie with zero expectation and knowledge of the plot. The film is a history of Le Mans '66 told with a thrill ride from Bale and Damon with stunning visual racing scenes. James Mangold has done a fantastic job as a director. Worth the watch in a movie theater.
10,"Review:
'Ford v Ferrari' is a sports-drama film directed by James Mangold.
What a film this is! I really wish I had waited to do my top ten list of 2019 until I seen this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time I was watching it.
The plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive visionary Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who are dispatched by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.
Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Jon Bernthal shows that he is more than an action guy when it comes to his acting capabilities, and Josh Lucas might just be the evillest villain to come out of 2019, including Thanos himself. What a dick he is in this movie and he plays it to perfection.
James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails. The race scenes have the tension they need, and Matt Damon and Christian Bale bring the humor without over doing it.
Overall, this is entertainment at its finest. There are some true story films that don't relate well to the big screen, this one will excel expectations. Great direction with a phenomenal cast is an A+.

10,One of the best movies I've seen this year. A reminder that not all modern movies suck.
10,"What a great movie this was! It has been some time since I felt so excited while watching a movie. It is simply great, no wonder why it was nominated, I hope it wins! GO WATCH IT! Superb!"
10,"Despite the love affair cinema has had with cars over the years, the sport of motor racing on film has been patchy. Too often the drama on the track has been deluged with melodrama off the track, as in John Frankenheimer's ""Grand Prix"" from 1966. While recent efforts such as Ron Howard's ""Rush"" have brought modern filming techniques to better convey the speed and excitement, it is Steve McQueen's ""Le Mans"" from 1971 that had previously set the bar for realism in the sport. But even there, there were a few off-track love stories to interweave into the action.I wouldn't hesitate to suggest that ""Le Mans '66"" is a strong contender for the motor racing high-water mark.The film was marketed as ""Ford v Ferrari"" in the US. (What... do the American distributors think their film-goers are so stupid that if ""Le"" is in the title they will think it sub-titled foreign language??). But it's a valid title, since the movie tells the true story of when Henry Ford... the second... (Tracy Letts) throws his toys out of the pram at Ford's faltering progress. (""James Bond does not drive a Ford"". ""That's because he's a degenerate!"" snaps back Ford, which kind of typifies the problem""). Marketing man Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) persuades retired hot-shot racer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to take Ford's blank-cheque to build a car to win the Le Mans 24 hour race.Shelby enlists maverick Brit racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help design and drive the next-generation machine. But neither had banked on the interference of the hoards of Ford suits, led by VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). An explosion is imminent! And its not just from the over-heated brake pads!What's really odd about this film is how linear the story is. While we get to see the family life of Miles (to add necessary context to what follows) these are merely minor diversions. There are no sub-plots or flashback scenes. It just relates the history from beginning to end, enlivened by some of the best and most exciting motor-racing footage put to celluloid.At a bladder-testing 152 minutes, this really shouldn't have worked. I should have got bored and restless. But I really didn't.In many ways - bladders aside - I think this will appeal in particular to an older breed of movie-goer. It's a 100% 'sit back in your seat and enjoy' cinema treat.This is the first film Matt Damon and Christian Bale have made together, and I understand that Damon specifically signed on since he wanted to work with Bale. And there is palpable chemistry there. The movie includes one of the best 'bad-fights' since Colin Firth and Hugh Grant locked horns in the Bridget Jones films. And Damon - never one of the most expressive actors in the world - here really shines.Bale also appears to be having a whale of a time. Not having to adopt a US accent suits him, as he blasts and swears his way through various UK-specific expletives that probably passed the US-censors by! He often tends to play characters in movies that are difficult to warm to, but here - although suitably spiky and irascible - the family man really shines through and you feel a real warmth for the guy.There's a strong supporting cast behind the leads, with Tracy Letts' fast-driving breakdown being a standout moment. I wonder how many takes they needed on that for Damon to keep a semi-straight face?! Also impressive as the son Peter Miles is Noah Jupe. If you're wondering where the hell you've seen him before, he was young (Marcus in ""A Quiet Place"").Where the film comes alive is on the track, and a particular shout out should to to the technical teams. Cinematography is by Phedon Papamichael (""Walk the Line""), film editing is led by Andrew Buckland and Michael McCusker. And sound mixing - which to my ear was piston-valve perfect - is by Steven Morrow. Also worthy of note is a kick-ass driving soundtrack by Marco Beltrami that genuinely excited. These categories are fearsomly hard to predict in awards season, but you might like to listen out for those names.If I was going to pick at any faults in the film, it would be that Ford exec Leo Beebe is painted a little too much as a ""boo-hiss"" pantomime villain in the piece. It could have been perhaps toned down 20% or so.James Mangold (""Logan""; ""Walk the Line"") directs in style. From the rather po-faced trailer, you might think this is a ""car movie that's not for me"". But it really is a tremendously fun movie, with some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments mixed in with edge-of-your-seat action and some heart-rending moments.Above all, this is a film that really benefits from the wide-screen and sound-system that only a big cinema can provide. As such this goes on my ""get out and see it"" list without any hesitation! It's going to make my movies of the year: and I'm off to see it again on Saturday!(Read the full graphical review on One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
10,"Once in a while, a big Hollywood film is made with big Hollywood stars, and big Hollywood production values and occasionally everything works to deliver a dynamic cinematic event.
Such is the case with director James Mangold's new film ""Ford v Ferrari"". Armed with superior talent in front and behind the camera, Mr. Mangold has directed his best film yet with bravado. A strong screenplay is the foundation of a great story involving the characters portrayed by Matt Damon playing American Car Designer Carroll Shelby, driver Christian Bale, and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, all involved in challenging the famous Italian car maker Ferrari at the famous race at Le Mans in 1966.
From the very first frame, James Mangold sets the tone with exciting, bold and energetic images that are visually arresting, alongside a great score that never overwhelms or feels generic. The editing is outstanding, as the pace is so fast moving, pulsating with nail biting excitement, especially in the racing sequences.
Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, along with Production Designer Francois Audouy, and Costume Designer Daniel Orlandi, have created a rich canvas, always authentic in feel, full of subtleties resulting in a formidable palette that comes together beautifully.
Flawless performances are a high point under the guidance of James Mangold's direction. Matt Damon has rarely had the opportunity to show quite a range from confidant showman to a vulnerability we rarely see. Christian Bale as always disappears into his character and delivers another stellar performance, and Tracy Letts layers his performance with strength and flair.
Ultimately, James Mangold's master work delivers on all fronts, and on the whole one of the most satisfying films of the year, and certain to be a major contender for many well deserved awards !"
10,"The Movie is brilliantly edited With an all cast Christian Bale & Matt Damon together its a perfect match for likeness of their characters. Matt Damon has certainly grown as an actor with versatility and we all know Christian Bale Becomes any character he portrays and is well suited to play another amazing man, Ken Miles. I love how they showed us the true Politics of the Motor Industry. Great true story, but as a Ford lover, Ford couldn't see the Forest through the trees! If wasn't for Miles And even then!!!"
10,"Absolutely wonderful, ""speedy"" and heart touching movie.
I feel a race in every detail: from beautiful shots to the amazing sound of cars and the rest.
My palms are sweating on the turns.
Good acting, good characters and good story.
Yeah. I feel it. I feel this in every turn."
10,"I have to say, I am a big fan of fast cars. And I am a big fan of Christian Bale and Matt Damon. So this Movie should be good. But this Movie was Awesome! It has it all. You Laugh, you cry and it is exciting!This Movie is not made for Petrolheads only, its a Movie for everyone!"
10,"This movie was perfect. I really don't care about cars or racing at all. I just love Christian Bale movies so I thought I'd take my dad to go see it. He's a big car junkie so I thought he'd like it. When the movie finished, the entire movie theater clapped. That was a first for me in my lifetime (I'm 25). Bale and Damon's acting was incredible. For a long movie, it went by quickly. The writing THANK GOD was perfect. There are so many awful movies and TV shows with some of the worst writing I've ever heard. I seriously feel like we are in the dark ages of theater. There are about 2 movies a year that are good. I rarely mark movies as a 10, but when I left the theater, I couldn't help but mark it down as a 10. I loved the movie from start to finish."
10,I generally don't enjoy going to the movies anymore since I can wait a few months and watch on our big screen in the comfort of my own home but I was excited to see this movie. We saw it the day it opened in our local theater and I was not disappointed. What a great film. Damon and Bale were fantastic from beginning to end. The characters were very well developed and you actually felt like you knew these guys! The whole cast was phenomenal. I'm not much of a race car fan but this movie had suspense and humor that made it entertaining for everyone! Well done!!
10,"Enjoyed everything about this movie. Christian Bale's performance was thoroughly entertaining. Matt Damon was solid along with the rest of the cast. A must see, surprisingly a lot of character development and heart."
10,"Decided to make an account and write this review just because how much I liked the movie, the acting was spot on and so was the cinematography.
watch the movie, you won't regret it."
10,"A friend asked me to go see it and I hadn't heard of it or knew what is was but I watched the trailer and thought, ""sure"" WOW what a movie. Bale and Damon were perfection in their roles. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I know nothing about racing. I had no idea anything like Le Mans existed.I hate how ken was treated but I loved what he did. He seemed like he was an amazing man, driver and engineer!! Ford owes him and Shelby everything!!"
10,"I actually agree with some of the other comments, especially the one that says something along the lines of this movie putting my faith in the movie business again. I expected bad acting on at least one of the two star actors parts (Damon, Bale), but this movie is good. A little slow in the beginning, but that's my only complaint (I literally fell asleep during the beginning and woke up and watched the rest of this great movie).The race at the end is good, but moreso from an emotional standpoint than an action packed standpoint. I feel like they could've had a few extra scenes to ""wow"" us at the end."
10,Honestly cannot believe how good this film is! Was fixated all the way through and was sad when it was over. Obviously being a racing film the cars are out of this world but had me laughing my head off at points Matt Damon and Christian bale are actors I usually avoid but in this both are superb. An absolute must watch
10,Ok perhaps not perfect. But so much more than just a great guys movie. Edge of your seat and tearjerker in one plus brimming with great performance and oozing style.
10,"I went into Ford v Ferrari a little unsure, as I'm not a huge racing fan, and wondered if the movie might be boring to me. My worry was unfounded - Ford v Ferrari is the best movie I've seen all year. It's surprisingly funny, completely engaging, historically accurate, and now my favorite Christian Bale movie. In fact, you'll forget you're watching Matt Damon and Christian Bale as they both completely disappear into their characters. So no spoilers here, just a recommendation to go see a great movie."
